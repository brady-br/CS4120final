				<p>Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a new vision for public key encryption that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages based on user attributes. For example, a user can create a ciphertext that can be decrypted only by other users with attributes satisfying (&quot;Faculty&quot; OR (&quot;PhD Student&quot; AND &quot;Quals Completed&quot;)). Given its expressiveness, ABE is currently being considered for many cloud storage and computing applications. However , one of the main efficiency drawbacks of ABE is that the size of the ciphertext and the time required to decrypt it grows with the complexity of the access formula. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for ABE that largely eliminates this overhead for users. Suppose that ABE ciphertexts are stored in the cloud. We show how a user can provide the cloud with a single transformation key that allows the cloud to translate any ABE ciphertext satisfied by that user&apos;s attributes into a (constant-size) El Gamal-style ciphertext, without the cloud being able to read any part of the user&apos;s messages. To precisely define and demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we provide new security definitions for both CPA and replayable CCA security with outsourc-ing, several new constructions, an implementation of our algorithms and detailed performance measurements. In a typical configuration, the user saves significantly on both bandwidth and decryption time, without increasing the number of transmissions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Traditionally, we have viewed encryption as a method for one user to encrypt data to another specific targeted party, such that only the target recipient can decrypt and read the message. However, in many applications a user might often wish to encrypt data according to some policy as opposed to specified set of users. Trying to realize such applications on top of a traditional public key mechanism poses a number of difficulties. For instance, a user encrypting data will need to have a mechanism which allows him to look up all parties that have access credentials or attributes that match his policy. These difficulties are compounded if a party's credentials themselves might be sensitive (e.g., the set of users with a TOP SE-CRET clearance) or if a party gains credentials well after data is encrypted and stored.</p><p>To address these issues, a new vision of encryption was put forth by <ref type="bibr">Sahai and Waters [38]</ref> called AttributeBased Encryption (ABE). In an ABE system, a user will associate an encryption of a message M with an function f (·), representing an access policy associated with the decryption. A user with a secret key that represents their set of attributes (e.g., credentials) S and will be able to decrypt a ciphertext associated with function f (·) if and only if f (S) = 1. Since the introduction of ABE there have been several other works proposing different variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> extending both functionality and refining security proof techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> One property that all of these ABE systems have is that both the ciphertext size and time for decryption grow with the size of the access formula f . Roughly, current efficient ABE realizations are set in pairing-based groups where the ciphertexts require two group elements for every node in the formula and decryption will require  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Summary of ABE outsourcing results. Above s denotes the size of an attribute set, refers to an LSSS access structure with an ×n matrix, k is the message bit length in RCCA schemes, and P, E G , E T stand for the maximum time to compute a pairing, exponentiation in G and exponentiation in G T respectively. We ignore non-dominant operations. All schemes are in the selective security setting. We discuss methods for moving to adaptive security in Section 5.1.</p><p>a pairing for each node in the satisfied formula. While conventional desktop computers should be able to handle such a task for typical formula sizes, this presents a significant challenge for users that manage and view private data on mobile devices where processors are often one to two orders of magnitude slower than their desktop counterparts and battery life is a persistent problem. Interestingly, in tandem there has emerged the ability for users to buy on-demand computing from cloud-based services such as Amazon's EC2 and Microsoft's Windows Azure. Can cloud services be securely used to outsource decryption in Attribute-Based Encryption systems? A naive first approach would be for a user to simply hand over their secret key, SK, to the outsourcing service. The service could then simply decrypt all ciphertexts requested by the user and then transmit the decrypted data. However, this requires complete trust of the outsourcing service; using the secret key the outsourcing service could read any encrypted message intended for the user.</p><p>A second approach might be to leverage recent outsourcing techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> based on Gentry's <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> fully homomorphic encryption system. These give outsourcing for general computations and importantly preserve the privacy of the inputs so that the decryption keys and messages can remain hidden. Unfortunately, the overhead for these systems is currently impractical. Gentry and Halevi <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> showed that even for weak security parameters one "bootstrapping" operation of the homomorphic operation would take at least 30 seconds on a high performance machine (and 30 minutes for the high security parameter). Since one such operation would only count for a small constant number of gates in the overall computation, this would need to be repeated many times to evaluate an ABE decryption using the methods above.</p><p>Closer to practice, we might leverage recent techniques on secure outsourcing of pairings <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. These techniques allow a client to outsource a pairing operation to a server. However, the solutions presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> still require the client to compute multiple exponentiations in the target group for every pairing it outsources. These exponentiations can be quite expensive and the work of the client will still be proportional to the size of the policy f . Moreover, every pairing operation in the original protocol will trigger four pairings do be done by the proxy. Thus, the total workload is increased by a factor of at least four from the original decryption algorithm, and the client's bandwidth requirements may actually increase. Given these drawbacks, we aim for an ABE outsourcing system that is secure and imposes minimal overhead.</p><p>Our Contributions. We give new methods for efficiently and securely outsourcing decryption of ABE ciphertexts. The core change to outsourceable ABE systems is a modified Key Generation algorithm that produces two keys. The first key is a short El Gamal <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> type secret key that must be kept private by the user. The second is what we call a "transformation key", TK, that is shared with a proxy (and can be publicly distributed). If the proxy then receives a ciphertext CT for a function f for which the user's credentials satisfy, it is then able to use the key TK to transform CT into a simple and short El Gamal ciphertext CT of the same message encrypted under the user's key SK. The user is then able to decrypt with one simple exponentiation. Our system is secure against any malicious proxy. Moreover, the computational effort of the proxy is no more than that used to decrypt a ciphertext in a standard ABE system.</p><p>To achieve our results, we create what we call a new key blinding technique. At a high level, the new outsourced key generation algorithm will first run a key generation algorithm from an existing bilinear map based ABE scheme such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Then it will choose a blinding factor exponent z ∈ Z p (for groups of prime order p) and raise all elements to z −1 (mod p). This will produce the transformation key TK, while the blinding factor z can serve as the secret key.</p><p>We show that we are able to adapt our outsourcing techniques to both the "Ciphertext-Policy" (CP-ABE) and "Key-Policy" (KP-ABE) types of ABE systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> To achieve our KP-ABE and CP-ABE outsourcing systems we respectively apply our methodology to the constructions of Goyal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. To prove security of the systems we must show that they remain secure even in the presence of an attacker that acts as a user's proxy. Our first systems and proofs model semantic security for an attacker that tries to eavesdrop on the user. We then extend our systems and proofs to chosen ciphertext attacks where the attack might query the user's decryption routine on maliciously formed ciphertexts to compromise privacy. Our solutions in this setting apply the random oracle heuristic to achieve efficiency near the chosen plaintext versions.</p><p>Typical Usage Scenarios. We envision a typical usage scenario in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 2 and 3</ref>. Here a client sends a single transformation key once to the proxy, who can then retrieve (potentially large) ABE ciphertexts that the user is interested in and forward to her (small, constant-size) El Gamal-type ciphertexts. The proxy could be the client's mail server, or the ciphertext server and the proxy could be the same entity, as in a cloud environment. The savings in bandwidth and local computation time for the client are immediate: a transformed ciphertext is always smaller and faster to decrypt than an ABE ciphertext of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> (for any policy size). We emphasize in this useage scenario that the number of transmissions will be the same as in the prior (non-outsourced) solutions. Thus, the power consumption can only improve with faster computations and smaller transmissions.</p><p>Implementation and Evaluation. To evaluate our outsourcing systems, we implemented the CP-ABE version is associated with a boolean access formula f and a user's key is a set of attributes x, where a user can decrypt if f (x) = 1. KP-ABE is useful in applications where we want to have the mirror image semantics where the attributes x are associated with a ciphertext and an access formula f with the key. and tested it in an outsourcing environment. Our implementation modified part of the libfenc <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> library, which includes a current CP-ABE implementation. We conducted our experiments on both an ARM-based mobile device and an Intel server to model the user device and proxy respectively.</p><p>Outsourcing decryption resulted in significant practical benefits. Decrypting on an ABE ciphertext containing 100 attributes, we found that without the use of a proxy the mobile device would require about 30 seconds of computation time and drain a significant amount of the device's battery. When we applied our outsourcing technique, decrypting the ciphertext took 2 seconds on our Intel server and approximately 60 milliseconds on the mobile device itself.</p><p>To demonstrate compatibility with existing infrastructure, we constructed a re-usable platform for outsourcing decryption using the Amazon EC2 service. Our proxy is deployed as a public Amazon Machine Image that can be programmatically instantiated by any application requiring acceleration.</p><p>In addition to the core benefits of outsourcing, we discovered other collateral advantages. In existing ABE implementations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> much of the decryption code is dedicated to determining how a policy is satisfied by a key and executing the corresponding pairing computations of decryption. In our outsourcing solution, most of this code is pushed into the untrusted transformation algorithm, leaving only a much smaller portion on the user's device. This has two advantages. First, the amount of decryption code that needs to reside on a resource constrained user device will be smaller. Actually, all bilinear map operations can be pushed outside. Second, this partitioning will dramatically decrease the size of the trusted code base, removing thousands of lines of complex parsing code. Even without using outsourcing, this partitioning of code is useful.</p><p>Related Work: Proxy Re-Encryption. In this work, we show how to delegate (in a true offline sense) the ability to transform an ABE ciphertext on message m into an El Gamal-style ciphertext on the same m, without learning anything about m. This is similar to the concept of proxy re-encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> where an untrusted proxy is given a re-encryption key that allows it to transform an encryption under Alice's key of m into an encryption under Bob's key of the same m, without allowing the proxy to learn anything about m.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>We first give the security definitions for ABE with outsourcing. We then give background information on bilinear maps. Finally, we provide formal definitions for access structures and relevant background on Linear Secret Sharing Schemes (LSSS), as taken from <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Types of ABE. We consider two distinct varieties of Attribute-Based Encryption: Ciphertext-Policy (CP-ABE) and Key-Policy (KP-ABE). In CP-ABE an access structure (policy) is embedded into the ciphertext during encryption, and each decryption key is based an some attribute set S. KP-ABE inverts this relationship, embedding S into the ciphertext and a policy into the key. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> We capture both paradigms in a generalized ABE definition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Access Structures</head><p>Definition 1 (Access Structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) Let {P 1 , P 2 , . . ., P n } be a set of parties. A collection A ⊆ 2 {P 1 ,P 2 ,...,P n } is monotone if ∀B,C : if B ∈ A and B ⊆ C then C ∈ A. An access structure (respectively, monotone access structure) is a collection (resp., monotone collection) A of non-empty subsets of {P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P n }, i.e., A ⊆ 2 {P 1 ,P 2 ,...,P n } \{ / 0}. The sets in A are called the authorized sets, and the sets not in A are called the unauthorized sets.</p><p>In our context, the role of the parties is taken by the attributes. Thus, the access structure A will contain the authorized sets of attributes. We restrict our attention to monotone access structures. However, it is also possible to (inefficiently) realize general access structures using our techniques by defining the "not" of an attribute as a separate attribute altogether. Thus, the number of attributes in the system will be doubled. From now on, unless stated otherwise, by an access structure we mean a monotone access structure.</p></div>

The traditional notion of security against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) is a bit too strong since it does not allow any bit of the ciphertext to be altered, and the purpose of our outsourcing is to compress the size of the ciphertext. We thus adopt a relaxation due to Canetti, Krawczyk and Nielsen <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> called replayable CCA security, which allows modifications to the ciphertext provided they cannot change the underlying message in a meaningful way. Definition 2 (RCCA-Secure ABE with Outsourcing) A CP-ABE or KP-ABE scheme with outsourcing is RCCA-secure (or secure against replayable chosenciphertext attacks) if all polynomial time adversaries have at most a negligible advantage in the RCCA game defined above.</p></div>

There exists a function ρ which maps each row of the matrix to an associated party. That is for i = 1, . . . , , the value ρ(i) is the party associated with row i. When we consider the column vector v = (s, r 2 , . . . , r n ), where s ∈ Z p is the secret to be shared, and r 2 , . . . , r n ∈ Z p are randomly chosen, then Mv is the vector of shares of the secret s according to Π. The share (Mv) i belongs to party ρ(i).</p><p>It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that every linear secret sharingscheme according to the above definition also enjoys the linear reconstruction property, defined as follows: Suppose that Π is an LSSS for the access structure A.

For our purposes, one can think of F as a random oracle. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: A CPA-secure KP-ABE outsourcing scheme based on the large-universe construction of Goyal, Pandey, Sahai and Waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Architecture and data flow for our cloud-based outsourcing proxy. An application programmatically instantiates one or more instances of the outsourcing proxy, which is loaded from a public Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in the S3 storage cloud. Next the application uploads a transform key TK to the proxy, and subsequently instructs the proxy to obtain ciphertexts from remote web servers or from locations within the S3 storage cloud. The proxy transforms the ciphertexts and returns the partially-decrypted result to the application, which completes decryption to obtain a plaintext. We emphasize that the setup step including uploading the transformation key only needs to be done once; subsequently, many decryption steps can follow. In an alternative configuration (not shown) the application can also upload ABE ciphertexts to the proxy from its local storage. We note the first configuration conflates the ciphertext delivery and partial decryption and thus requires no additional transmissions relative to non outsourcing solutions. The alternative will require an round trip for each outsourcing operation.</p><p>One might hope that the proof of adaptive security could be a black box reduction to the adaptively secure schemes of Lewko et al. Unfortunately, this seems infeasible. Consider any direct black box reduction to the security of the underlying scheme. When the attacker makes a query to some transformation key, the reduction algorithm has two options. First, it could ask the security game for the underlying ABE system for a private key. Yet, it might turn out that the key both is never corrupted and is capable of decryption for the eventual challenge ciphertext. In this case the simulator will have to abort. A second option is for the reduction algorithm not to ask for such a key, but fill in the transformation key itself. However, if that user's key is later corrupted it will be difficult for the reduction to both ask for such a private key and match it to the published transformation key.</p><p>Accordingly, to prove security one needs to make a direct Dual-System encryption type proof. The proof would go along the lines of Lewko et al., with the exception that in the hybrid stage of the proof all private keys and transformational keys will be set (one by one) to be semi-functional including those that could decrypt the eventual challenge ciphertext. In the Lewko et al. proof giving a private key that could decrypt the challenge ciphertext would undesirably result in the simulator producing observably incorrect correlations between the challenge ciphertext and keys. However, if we only give out the transformation part of such a key (and keep the whole private key hidden) then this correlation will remain hidden. This part of the argument is somewhat similar to the work of Lewko, Rouselakis, and Waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, who show that in their leakage resilient ABE scheme if only part of a private key is leaked such a correlation will be hidden.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Checking the Transformation</head><p>In the description of our systems a proxy will be able to transform any ABE ciphertext into a short ciphertext for the user. While the security definitions show that an attacker will not be able to learn an encrypted message, there is no guarantee on the transformation's correctness.</p><p>In some applications a user might want to request the transformation of a particular ciphertext and (efficiently) check that the transformation was indeed done correctly (assuming the original ciphertext was valid). It is easy to adapt our RCCA systems to such a setting. Since decryption results in recovery of the ciphertext randomness, one can simply add a tag to the ciphertext as H (r), where H is a different hash function modeled as a random oracle and r is the ciphertext randomness. On recovery of r the user can compute H (r) and make sure it matches the tag.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Performance in Practice</head><p>To validate our results, we implemented the CPA-secure CP-ABE of Section 3 as an extension to the libfenc Attribute Based Encryption library <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. We then used this as a building block for a platform for accelerating ABE decryption through cloud-based computing resources.</p><p>The core of our solution is a virtualized outsourcing "proxy" that runs in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Our proxy exists as a machine image that can be programmatically instantiated by any application that requires assistance with ABE decryption. As we demonstrate below, this proxy is particularly useful for accelerating decryption on constrained devices such as mobile phones. However, the system can be used in any application where significant numbers of ABE decryptions must be performed, e.g., in large-scale search operations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The use of on-demand computing is particularly well-suited to our outsourcing techniques, since we do not require trusted remote servers or long-term storage of secrets.</p><p>System Architecture. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> illustrates the architecture of our outsourcing platform. The proxy is stored in Amazon's S3 datastore as a public Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which wraps a standard Linux/Apache distribution along with the code needed to execute the Transform algorithm. Applications can remotely instantiate the proxy and upload a TK corresponding to a particular ABE decryption key. 11 Depending on the use case, they can either push ciphertexts to the proxy for transformation, or direct the proxy to retrieve ABE ciphertexts from remote locations such as the web or the Amazon S3 storage cloud. The latter technique is helpful when accessing remotely-held records on a mobile device, since the proxy transformation dramatically reduces the mobile device's bandwidth requirements vs. downloading and decrypting each ABE ciphertext locally. This can significantly enhance device battery life.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Performance: Microbenchmarks</head><p>To evaluate the performance of our CPA-secure CP-ABE outsourcing scheme in isolation (without confounding factors such as network lag, file I/O, etc.) we conducted a series of microbenchmarks using the libfenc implementation. For consistency, we ran these tests on two dedicated hardware platforms: a 3GHz Intel Core Duo platform with 4GB of RAM running 32-bit Linux Kernel version 2.6.32, and a 412MHz ARM-based iPhone 3G with 128MB of RAM running iOS 4.0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> We instantiated the ABE schemes using a 224-bit MNT elliptic curve from the Stanford Pairing-Based Crypto library <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The existing libfenc implementation implements the Waters scheme using a Key Encapsulation variant. For backwards compatibility, we adopted this approach in our implementation as well. Herein, the ciphertext carries a symmetric session key k that is computed at encryption time as k = H(e(g, g) αs ). The element C = 10 Indeed, since cloud computing platforms support the creation of multiple proxy instances, servers can rapidly scale their outsourcing capability up and down to meet demand. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> The proxy requires only one TK to decrypt an unlimited number of ciphertexts. However, a proxy can be shared by multiple users, each with their own TK. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Note that our tests were single-threaded, and thus used resources from only a single core of the Intel processor. In all cases we conducted our timing experiments with accessible background services disabled, and with the mobile device connected to a power source. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Although we define our schemes in the symmetric bilinear group setting, the MNT curve choice required that we implement the scheme in asymmetric groups with a pairing of the form G 1 × G 2 → G T . As a result we assigned various elements of the ciphertext and key to the groups G 1 and G 2 with the aim of minimizing ciphertext size.</p><p>M · e(g, g) αs is omitted from the ciphertext, and any data payload must be carried via a separate symmetric encryption under k. The practical impact of this approach is that the ABE ciphertexts (and partially-decrypted ciphertexts) are shortened by one element of G T .</p><p>Experimental setup. Both decryption time and ciphertext size in the CP-ABE scheme depend on the complexity of the ciphertext's policy. To capture this in our experiments, we first generated a collection of 100 distinct ciphertext policies of the form (A 1 AND A 2 AND . . . AND A N ), where each A i is an attribute, for values of N increasing from 1 to 100. In each case we constructed a corresponding decryption key that contained the N attributes necessary for decryption. This approach ensures that the decryption procedure depends on all N components of the ciphertext and is a reasonable sample of a complex policy.</p><p>To obtain our baseline results, we encapsulated a random 128-bit symmetric key under each of these 100 different policies, then decrypted the resulting ABE ciphertext using the normal (non-outsourced) Decrypt algorithm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> To smooth any experimental variability, we repeated each of our experiments 100 times on the Intel device (due to the time consuming nature of the experiments, we repeated the test only 30 times on the ARM device) and averaged to obtain our decryption timings. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows the size of the resulting ciphertexts as a function of N, along with the measured decryption times on our Intel and ARM test platforms.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the algorithms by generating a Transform Key (TK) from the appropriate N-attribute ABE decryption key and applying the Transform algorithm to the ABE ciphertext using this key. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Finally we decrypted the resulting transformed ciphertext. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows the time required for each of those operations.</p><p>Discussion. As expected, the ABE ciphertext size and decryption/transform time were linear in the complexity of the ciphertext's policy (N). However, our results illustrate the surprisingly high constants. Encrypting under a 100-component ciphertext policy produced an unwieldy 25KB of ABE ciphertext. The relatively fast Intel processor required nearly 2 full seconds to decrypt this value. By comparison, the same machine can perform a 1024-bit RSA decryption in 1.7 milliseconds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> The results were more dramatic on the mobile device. Decrypting a 100-component ciphertext policy on the Timing results are provided for both Intel and ARM platforms. Key generation times represent the time to convert a standard ABE decryption key into an outsourcing key, using the "backwards-compatible" approach described in Section 3.1. "Final decryption" refers to the decryption of a partially-decrypted ciphertext. Note that we present the Transform timing results for the Intel platform only, since we view this as the more likely outsourcing platform. Intel (resp. ARM) timings represent the average of 100 (resp. 30) test iterations.</p><p>ARM processor required nearly 30 seconds of sustained computation. Even at lower policy complexities, our results seem problematic for implementers looking to deploy unassisted ABE on limited computing devices.</p><p>Outsourcing substantially reduced both ciphertext size and the time needed to decrypt the partially-decrypted ciphertext. Each partially-decrypted ciphertext was a fixed 188 bytes in size, regardless of the original ciphertext's CP-ABE policy. Furthermore, the final decryption process required only 4ms on the Intel processor and a manageable 60ms on ARM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Thus, it appears that outsourcing can provide a noticeable decryption time advantage for ciphertexts with 10 or more attributes.</p><p>Other Implementation Remarks. There are several optimizations and tradeoffs one might explore that could impact both the performance of the existing ABE scheme and our outsourced scheme. We chose to use the PBC library due to its use in the libfenc system and its simple API. However, PBC does not include all of the latest optimizations discussed in the research literature. Other future optimizations could include the use of multi-pairings for decryption. We emphasize that while using such op- <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> We conducted our experiments on the CPA-secure version of our scheme. The primary performance differences in the RCCA version are an extra exponentiation in G T and some additional bytes. timizations to the existing ABE systems could give some performance improvements, they will not improve the size of ABE ciphertexts. Furthermore, decryption time will still be linear in the size of the satisfied formula, whereas our outsourcing technique transforms the final decryption step to a short El-Gamal-type ciphertext.</p><p>A note on policy complexity. The reader might assume that 50-or 100-component policies are rare in practice. In fact, we observed that it is relatively easy to arrive at highly complex policies in typical use cases. This is particularly true when using policies that contain integer comparison operators, e.g., "AGE &lt; 30". The libfenc library implements integer comparison operators using the technique of Bethencourt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>: prior to encryption, each comparison operator is converted into a boolean policy circuit composed of OR and AND gates, and the resulting policy is applied to the ciphertext. Comparing an attribute to a fixed n-bit integer adds approximately n components to the policy. For example, without special optimizations, a restriction window involving a Unix time value (x &lt; KEY CREATION TIME &lt; y) increases the policy size by approximately 64 components.   <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: Some average performance results for the proxy-enhanced iHealthEHR application running on our iPhone 3G.

"proxy" indicates local ciphertext storage with proxy outsourcing. "proxy+web" indicates that ciphertexts were obtained from the web via the proxy. Where relevant we provide both timings and total bandwidth transferred (up+down) from the device. Note that proxy launch times exhibit some variability depending on factors outside of our control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Performance: Mobile Example</head><p>To validate our ideas in a real application, we incorporated outsourcing into the iPhone viewer component of iHealthEHR <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, an experimental system for distributing Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Since EHRs can contain highly sensitive data, iHealthEHR uses CP-ABE to perform end-to-end encryption of records from the origination point to the viewing device. Distinct ciphertext policies may be applied to each node in an individual's health record (e.g., to admit special permissions for psychiatric records). iHealthEHR supports both local and cloud-based storage of records. We modified the iPhone application to remotely instantiate our outsourcing proxy on startup, using a "small" server instance within Amazon's storage cloud. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> In our experiments we found that the first EC2 instantiation required anywhere from 1-3 minutes, presumably depending on the system's load. However, once the proxy was launched, it could be left running indefinitely and shared by many different users with different TKs, or -when not in use -paused and brought back to full operation in as little as 30 seconds (with an average closer to 45 seconds). During this startup interval we set the application to locally process all decryption operations. Once the proxy signaled its availability, the application pushed a TK to it via HTTP, and outsourced all further decryption operations.</p><p>To evaluate the performance implications, we conducted experiments on the system with outsourcing enabled and disabled, considering four likely usage scenarios. In the first scenario (local-only), we conducted device-local decryption on ciphertexts stored locally in the device's Flash memory. In the second scenario (local+web) we downloaded ciphertexts from a web server, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> According to Amazon's documentation, a small EC2 instance provides "the equivalent CPU capacity of a 1.0-1.2 GHz 2007 Opteron or 2007 Xeon processor" and 1.7GB of RAM, at a cost of USD $0.085/hr. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. then decrypted them locally at the device. In the third scenario (proxy), we stored ciphertexts locally and then uploaded them to the proxy for transformation. In the final scenario (proxy+web) ciphertexts were retrieved from a web server by the proxy, then Transformed before being sent to the device. In each case we measured the time required to decrypt, along with the total bandwidth transmitted and received by the device (excepting the local-only case, which did not employ the network connection). The results are summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p></div>

McCune et al. recently proposed TrustVisor <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, a specialized hypervisor designed to protect and isolate security-sensitive "Pieces of Application Logic" (PALs) from less sensitive code.</p><p>We propose outsourcing as a tool to harden ABE implementations in platforms with code isolation. For example, in a system equipped with TrustVisor, implementers can embed the relatively simple key generation and Decrypt out routines in security-sensitive code (e.g., a TrustVisor PAL) and use outsourcing to push the remaining calculations into non-sensitive code. This not only reduces the size of the sensitive code base, it also simplifies parameter validation for the PAL (since the partially-decrypted ABE ciphertext is substantially less complex than the original). We refer to this technique as "self-outsourcing" and note that it can also be used in systems containing hardware security modules (e.g., cryptographic smart cards). Moreover, based on our experiments of Section 6, we estimate that this approach will have a minimal impact on performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Illustration of how ABE ciphertexts are fetched today.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Proof of Theorem 3.2</head><p>Proof. Suppose there exists a polynomial-time adversary A that can attack our scheme in the selective RCCAsecurity model for outsourcing with advantage ε. We build a simulator B that can attack the Waters scheme of <ref type="bibr">[42, Appendix C]</ref> in the selective CPA-security model with advantage ε minus a negligible amount. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> the Waters scheme is proven secure under the decisional qparallel BDHE assumption. Init. The simulator B runs A . A chooses the challenge access structure (M * , ρ * ), which B passes on to the Waters challenger as the structure on which it wishes to be challenged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup.</head><p>The simulator B obtains the Waters public parameters PK = g, e(g, g) α , g a and a description of the hash function F. It sends these to A as the public parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phase 1.</head><p>The simulator B initializes empty tables T, T 1 , T 2 , an empty set D and an integer j = 0. It answers the adversary's queries as follows:</p><p>• Random Oracle Hash H 1 (R, M ): If there is an entry (R, M , s) in T 1 , return s. Otherwise, choose a random s ∈ Z p , record (R, M , s) in T 1 and return s.</p><p>• Random Oracle Hash H 2 (R): If there is an entry (R, r) in T 2 , return r. Otherwise, choose a random r ∈ {0, 1} k , record (R, r) in T 2 and return r.</p><p>• Create((S)): B sets j := j + 1. It now proceeds one of two ways.</p><p>-If S satisfies (M * , ρ * ), then it chooses a "fake" transformation key as follows: choose a random d ∈ Z p and run KeyGen((d, PK), S) to obtain SK . Set TK = SK and set SK = (d, TK). Note that the pair (d, TK) is not wellformed, but that TK is properly distributed if d was replaced by the unknown value z = α/d. -Otherwise, it calls the Waters key generation oracle on S to obtain the key SK</p><p>(Recall that in the non-outsourcing CP-ABE game, the Create and Corrupt functionalities are combined in one oracle.) The algorithm chooses a random value z ∈ Z p and sets the transformation key TK as (PK,</p><p>x } x∈S ) and the private key as (z, TK).</p><p>Finally, store ( j, S, SK, TK) in table T and return TK to A .</p><p>• Corrupt(i): A cannot ask to corrupt any key corresponding to the challenge structure (M * , ρ * ). If there exists an ith entry in table T , then B obtains the entry (i, S, SK, TK) and sets D := D ∪ {S}. It then returns SK to A , or ⊥ if no such entry exists.</p><p>• Decrypt(i, CT): Without loss of generality, we assume that all ciphertexts input to this oracle are already partially decrypted. Recall that both B and A have access to the TK values for all keys created, so either can execute the transformation operation. Let CT = (C 0 ,C 1 ,C 2 ) be associated with structure (M, ρ). Obtain the record (i, S, SK, TK) from table T . If it is not there or S ∈ (M, ρ), return ⊥ to A .</p><p>If key i does not satisfy the challenge structure (M * , ρ * ), proceed as follows: If key i does satisfy the challenge structure (M * , ρ * ), proceed as follows:</p><p>. If zero matches are found, B outputs ⊥ to A . 4. If more than one matches are found, B aborts the simulation. 5. Otherwise, let (R, M , s) be the sole match.</p><p>Obtain the record (R, r) from table T 2 . If it does not exist, B outputs ⊥. 6. Test if C 0 = R·e(g, g) αs , C 1 = M ⊕r and C 2 = e(g, g) ds . 7. If all tests pass, output M ; else, output ⊥.</p><p>Challenge. Eventually, A submits a message pair (M * 0 , M * 1 ) ∈ {0, 1} 2×k . B acts as follows: 1. B chooses random "messages" (R 0 , R 1 ) ∈ G 2 T and passes them on to the Waters challenger to obtain a ciphertext CT = (C,C , {C i } i∈ <ref type="bibr">[1,]</ref> ) under (M * , ρ * ). 2. B chooses a random value C ∈ {0, 1} k . 3. B sends to A the challenge ciphertext CT * = (C,C ,C , {C i } i∈ <ref type="bibr">[1,]</ref> ).</p><p>Phase 2. The simulator B continues to answer queries as in Phase 1, except that if the response to a Decrypt query would be either M * 0 or M * 1 , then B responds with the message test instead.</p><p>Guess. Eventually, A must either output a bit or abort, either way B ignores it. Next, B searches through tables T 1 and T 2 to see if the values R 0 or R 1 appear as the first element of any entry (i.e., that A issued a query of the form H 1 (R i , ·) or H 2 (R i ).) If neither or both values appear, B outputs a random bit as its guess. If only value R b appears, then B outputs b as its guess.</p><p>This ends the description of the simulation. Due to space limitations, our analysis of this simulation appears in the full version of this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>			</div>
