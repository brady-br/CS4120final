				<p>Memory access bugs, including buffer overflows and uses of freed heap memory, remain a serious problem for programming languages like C and C++. Many memory error detectors exist, but most of them are either slow or detect a limited set of bugs, or both. This paper presents AddressSanitizer, a new memory error detector. Our tool finds out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack, and global objects, as well as use-after-free bugs. It employs a specialized memory allocator and code instrumentation that is simple enough to be implemented in any compiler, binary translation system, or even in hardware. AddressSanitizer achieves efficiency without sacrificing comprehensiveness. Its average slowdown is just 73% yet it accurately detects bugs at the point of occurrence. It has found over 300 previously unknown bugs in the Chromium browser and many bugs in other software.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Dozens of memory error detection tools are available on the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24]</ref>. These tools differ in speed, memory consumption, types of detectable bugs, probability of detecting a bug, supported platforms, and other characteristics. Many tools succeed in detecting a wide range of bugs but incur high overhead, or incur low overhead but detect fewer bugs. We present AddressSanitizer, a new tool that combines performance and coverage. AddressSanitizer finds out-of-bounds accesses (for heap, stack, and global objects) and uses of freed heap memory at the relatively low cost of 73% slowdown and 3.4x increased memory usage, making it a good choice for testing a wide range of C/C++ applications.</p><p>AddressSanitizer consists of two parts: an instrumentation module and a run-time library. The instrumentation module modifies the code to check the shadow state for each memory access and creates poisoned redzones around stack and global objects to detect overflows and underflows. The current implementation is based on the LLVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> compiler infrastructure. The run-time library replaces malloc, free and related functions, creates poisoned redzones around allocated heap regions, delays the reuse of freed heap regions, and does error reporting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Contributions</head><p>In this paper we:</p><p>• show that a memory error detector can leverage the comprehensiveness of shadow memory with much lower overhead than the conventional wisdom;</p><p>• present a novel shadow state encoding that enables compact shadow memory -as much as a 128-to-1 mapping -for detecting out-of-bounds and useafter-free bugs;</p><p>• describe a specialized memory allocator targeting our shadow encoding;</p><p>• evaluate a new publicly available tool that efficiently identifies memory bugs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Outline</head><p>After summarizing related work in the next section, we describe the AddressSanitizer algorithm in Section 3.</p><p>Experimental results with AddressSanitizer are provided in Section 4. We discuss further improvements in Section 5 and then conclude the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Shadow Memory</head><p>Many different tools use shadow memory to store metadata corresponding to each piece of application data.</p><p>Typically an application address is mapped to a shadow address either by a direct scale and offset, where the full application address space is mapped to a single shadow address space, or by extra levels of translation involving table lookups. Examples of direct mapping include TaintTrace <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> and LIFT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref>. TaintTrace requires a shadow space of equal size to the application address space, which results in difficulties supporting applications that cannot survive with only one-half of their normal address space. The shadow space in LIFT is oneeighth of the application space.</p><p>To provide more flexibility in address space layout, some tools use multi-level translation schemes. Valgrind <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref> and Dr. Memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> split their shadow memory into pieces and use a table lookup to obtain the shadow address, requiring an extra memory load. For 64-bit platforms, Valgrind uses an additional table layer for application addresses not in the lower 32GB.</p><p>Umbra <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">31]</ref> combines layout flexibility with efficiency, avoiding a table lookup via a non-uniform and dynamically-tuned scale and offset scheme. BoundLess <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> stores some of its metadata in 16 higher bits of 64-bit pointers, but falls back to more traditional shadow memory on the slow path. LBC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> performs a fastpath check using special values stored in the application memory and relies on two-level shadow memory on the slow path.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Instrumentation</head><p>A large number of memory error detectors are based on binary instrumentation. Among the most popular are Valgrind (Memcheck) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>, Dr. Memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, Purify <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, BoundsChecker <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>, Intel Parallel Inspector <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> and Discover <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref>. These tools find out-of-bounds and useafter-free bugs for heap memory with (typically) no false positives. To the best of our knowledge none of the tools based on binary instrumentation can find out-of-bounds bugs in the stack (other than beyond the top of the stack) or globals. These tools additionally find uninitialized reads.</p><p>Mudflap <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> uses compile-time instrumentation and hence is capable of detecting out-of-bounds accesses for stack objects. However, it does not insert redzones between different stack objects in one stack frame and will thus not detect all stack buffer overflow bugs. It is also known to have false positive reports in complex C++ code 1 .</p><p>1 http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show bug.cgi?id=19319</p><p>CCured <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref> combines instrumentation with static analysis (only for C programs) to eliminate redundant checks; their instrumentation is incompatible with uninstrumented libraries.</p><p>LBC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> uses source-to-source transformation and relies on CCured to eliminate redundant checks. LBC is limited to the C language and does not handle use-afterfree bugs.</p><p>Insure++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> relies mainly on compile-time instrumentation but also uses binary instrumentation. Details of its implementation are not publicly available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Debug Allocators</head><p>Another class of memory error detectors uses a specialized memory allocator and does not change the rest of the execution.</p><p>Tools like Electric Fence <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>, Duma <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>, GuardMalloc <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> and Page Heap <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref> use CPU page protection. Each allocated region is placed into a dedicated page (or a set of pages). One extra page at the right (and/or at the left) is allocated and marked as inaccessible. A subsequent page fault accessing these pages is then reported as an out-of-bounds error. These tools incur large memory overheads and may be very slow on malloc-intensive applications (as each malloc call requires at least one system call). Also, these tools may miss some classes of bugs (e.g., reading the byte at offset 6 from the start of a 5-byte memory region). If a bug is reported, the responsible instruction is provided in the error message.</p><p>Some other malloc implementations, including DieHarder <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> (a descendant of DieHard <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> malloc) and Dmalloc <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>, find memory bugs on a probabilistic and/or delayed basis. Their modified malloc function adds redzones around memory regions returned to the user and populates the newly allocated memory with special magic values. The free function also writes magic values to the memory region.</p><p>If a magic value is read then the program has accessed an out-of-bounds or uninitialized value. However, there is no immediate detection of this. Through properly selected magic values, there is a chance that the program will behave incorrectly in a way detectable by existing application tests (DieHard <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> has a replicated mode in which it is able to detect such incorrect behavior by comparing the output of several program replicas initialized with different magic values). In other words, the detection of out-of-bounds reads and read-after-free bugs is probabilistic.</p><p>If a magic value in a redzone is overwritten, this will later be detected when the redzone is examined on free, but the tool does not know exactly when the out-ofbounds write or write-after-free occurred. For large programs it is often equivalent to reporting "your program has a bug". Note that the goal of DieHarder is not only to detect bugs, but also to protect from security attacks.</p><p>The two debug malloc approaches are often combined. Debug malloc tools do not handle stack variables or globals.</p><p>The same magic value technique is often used for buffer overflow protection. StackGuard <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref> and ProPolice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> (the StackGuard reimplementation currently used by GCC) place a canary value between the local variables and the return address in the current stack frame and check for that value's consistency upon function exit. This helps to prevent stack smashing buffer overflows, but is unable to detect arbitrary out-of-bounds accesses to stack objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">AddressSanitizer Algorithm</head><p>From a high level, our approach to memory error detection is similar to that of the Valgrind-based tool AddrCheck <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>: use shadow memory to record whether each byte of application memory is safe to access, and use instrumentation to check the shadow memory on each application load or store. However, AddressSanitizer uses a more efficient shadow mapping, a more compact shadow encoding, detects errors in stack and global variables in addition to the heap and is an order of magnitude faster than AddrCheck. The following sections describe how AddressSanitizer encodes and maps its shadow memory, inserts its instrumentation, and how its run-time library operates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Shadow Memory</head><p>The memory addresses returned by the malloc function are typically aligned to at least 8 bytes. This leads to the observation that any aligned 8-byte sequence of application heap memory is in one of 9 different states: the first k (0 ≤ k ≤ 8) bytes are addressable and the remaining 8 − k bytes are not. This state can be encoded into a single byte of shadow memory.</p><p>AddressSanitizer dedicates one-eighth of the virtual address space to its shadow memory and uses a direct mapping with a scale and offset to translate an application address to its corresponding shadow address. Given the application memory address Addr, the address of the shadow byte is computed as (Addr&gt;&gt;3)+Offset. If Max-1 is the maximum valid address in the virtual address space, the value of Offset should be chosen in such a way that the region from Offset to Offset+Max/8 is not occupied at startup. Unlike in Umbra <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31]</ref>, the Offset must be chosen statically for every platform, but we do not see this as a serious limitation. On a typical 32-bit Linux or MacOS system, where the virtual address space is 0x00000000-0xffffffff, we use Offset = 0x20000000 <ref type="formula">(2 29</ref> ). On a 64-bit system with 47 significant address bits we use Offset = 0x0000100000000000 (2 44 ). In some cases (e.g., with -fPIE/-pie compiler flags on Linux) a zero offset can be used to simplify instrumentation even further. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the address space layout. The application memory is split into two parts (low and high) which map to the corresponding shadow regions. Applying the shadow mapping to addresses in the shadow region gives us addresses in the Bad region, which is marked inaccessible via page protection.</p><p>We use the following encoding for each shadow byte: 0 means that all 8 bytes of the corresponding application memory region are addressable; k (1 ≤ k ≤ 7) means that the first k bytes are addressible; any negative value indicates that the entire 8-byte word is unaddressable. We use different negative values to distinguish between different kinds of unaddressable memory (heap redzones, stack redzones, global redzones, freed memory).</p><p>This shadow mapping could be generalized to the form (Addr&gt;&gt;Scale)+Offset, where Scale is one of 1 . . . 7. With Scale=N, the shadow memory occupies 1/2 N of the virtual address space and the minimum size of the redzone (and the malloc alignment) is 2 N bytes. Each shadow byte describes the state of 2 N bytes and encodes 2 N + 1 different values. Larger values of Scale require less shadow memory but greater redzone sizes to satisfy alignment requirements. Values of Scale greater than 3 require more complex instrumentation for 8-byte accesses (see Section 3.2) but provide more flexibility with applications that may not be able to give up a single contiguous one-eighth of their address space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Instrumentation</head><p>When instrumenting an 8-byte memory access, AddressSanitizer computes the address of the corresponding shadow byte, loads that byte, and checks whether it is zero:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ShadowAddr = (Addr &gt;&gt; 3) + Offset; if (*ShadowAddr != 0)</formula><p>ReportAndCrash(Addr);</p><p>When instrumenting 1-, 2-, or 4-byte accesses, the instrumentation is slightly more complex: if the shadow value is positive (i.e., only the first k bytes in the 8-byte word are addressable) we need to compare the 3 last bits of the address with k.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ShadowAddr = (Addr &gt;&gt; 3) + Offset; k = *ShadowAddr; if (k != 0 &amp;&amp; ((Addr &amp; 7) + AccessSize &gt; k))</formula><p>ReportAndCrash(Addr);</p><p>In both cases the instrumentation inserts only one memory read for each memory access in the original code. We assume that an N-byte access is aligned to N. AddressSanitizer may miss a bug caused by an unaligned access, as described in Section 3.5.</p><p>We placed the AddressSanitizer instrumentation pass at the very end of the LLVM optimization pipeline. This way we instrument only those memory accesses that survived all scalar and loop optimizations performed by the LLVM optimizer. For example, memory accesses to local stack objects that are optimized away by LLVM will not be instrumented. At the same time we don't have to instrument memory accesses generated by the LLVM code generator (e.g., register spills).</p><p>The error reporting code (ReportAndCrash(Addr)) is executed at most once, but is inserted in many places in the code, so it still must be compact. Currently we use a simple function call (see examples in Appendix A). Another option would be to use an instruction that generates a hardware exception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Run-time Library</head><p>The main purpose of the run-time library is to manage the shadow memory. At application startup the entire shadow region is mapped so that no other part of the program can use it. The Bad segment of the shadow memory is protected. On Linux the shadow region is always unoccupied at startup so the memory mapping always succeeds. On MacOS we need to disable the address space layout randomization (ASLR). Our preliminary experiments show that the same shadow memory layout also works on Windows.</p><p>The malloc and free functions are replaced with a specialized implementation. The malloc function allocates extra memory, the redzone, around the returned region. The redzones are marked as unaddressable, or poisoned. The larger the redzone, the larger the overflows or underflows that will be detected.</p><p>The memory regions inside the allocator are organized as an array of freelists corresponding to a range of object sizes. When a freelist that corresponds to a requested object size is empty, a large group of memory regions with their redzones is allocated from the operating system (using, e.g., mmap). For n regions we allocate n + 1 redzones, such that the right redzone of one region is typically a left redzone of another region: rz1 mem1 rz2 mem2 rz3 mem3 rz4</p><p>The left redzone is used to store the internal data of the allocator (such as the allocation size, thread ID, etc.); consequently, the minimum size of the heap redzone is currently 32 bytes. This internal data can not be corrupted by a buffer underflow, because such underflows are detected immediately prior to the actual store (if the underflow happens in the instrumented code).</p><p>The free function poisons the entire memory region and puts it into quarantine, such that this region will not be allocated by malloc any time soon. Currently, the quarantine is implemented as a FIFO queue which holds a fixed amount of memory at any time.</p><p>By default, malloc and free record the current call stack in order to provide more informative bug reports. The malloc call stack is stored in the left redzone (the larger the redzone, the larger the number of frames that can be stored) while the free call stack is stored in the beginning of the memory region itself. Section 4.3 discusses how to tune the run-time library.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Stack And Globals</head><p>In order to detect out-of-bounds accesses to globals and stack objects, AddressSanitizer must create poisoned redzones around such objects. For globals, the redzones are created at compile time and the addresses of the redzones are passed to the runtime library at application startup. The run-time library function poisons the redzones and records the addresses for further error reporting.</p><p>For stack objects, the redzones are created and poisoned at run-time. Currently, redzones of 32 bytes (plus up to 31 bytes for alignment) are used. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">False Negatives</head><p>The instrumentation scheme described above may miss a very rare type of bug: an unaligned access that is partially out-of-bounds. For example:</p><p>int *a = new int <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2]</ref>; // 8-aligned int *u = (int*)((char*)a + 6); *u = 1; // Access to range <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> Currently we ignore this type of bug since all solutions we have come up with slow down the common path. Solutions we considered include:</p><p>• check at run-time whether the address is unaligned;</p><p>• use a byte-to-byte shadow mapping (feasible only on 64-bit systems);</p><p>• use a more compact mapping (e.g., Scale=7 from Section 3.1) to minimize the probability of missing such a bug.</p><p>AddressSanitizer may also miss bugs in the following two cases (tools like Valgrind or Dr. Memory have the same problems). First, if an out-of-bounds access touches memory too far away from the object bound it may land in a different valid allocation and the bug will be missed. All out-of-bounds accesses within the heap redzone will be detected with 100% probability. If the memory footprint is not a serious constraint we recommend using large redzones of up to 128 bytes.</p><p>Second, a use-after-free may not be detected if a large amount of memory has been allocated and deallocated between the "free" and the following use. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">False Positives</head><p>In short, AddressSanitizer has no false positives. However, during the AddressSanitizer development and deployment we have seen a number of undesirable error reports described below, all of which are now fixed. To avoid this problem we partially disabled load widening in LLVM when AddressSanitizer instrumentation is enabled. We still allow widening x.a+x.b into a 2-byte load, because such a transformation will not cause false positives and will speedup the instrumented code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.1">Conflict With Load Widening</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.2">Conflict With Clone</head><p>We have observed several false reports in the presence of the clone system call 2 . First, a process calls clone with the CLONE VM|CLONE FILES flags, which creates a child process that shares memory with the parent. In particular, the memory used by the child's stack still belongs to the parent. Then the child process calls a function that has objects on the stack and the AddressSanitizer instrumentation poisons the stack object redzones. Finally, without exiting the function and un-poisoning the redzones, the child process calls a function that never returns (e.g., exit or exec). As a result, part of the parent address space remains poisoned and AddressSanitizer reports an error later when this memory is reused. We solved this problem by finding never return function calls (functions like exit or exec have this attribute) and unpoisoning the entire stack memory before the call. For similar reasons the AddressSanitizer run-time library has to intercept longjmp and C++ exceptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.3">Intentional Wild Dereferences</head><p>We have seen several cases where a function intentionally reads wild memory locations. For example, low level code iterates between two addresses on the stack crossing multiple stack frames. For these cases we have implemented a function attribute no address safety analysis which should be added to the function declaration in the C/C++ source. These cases are rare; e.g., in the Chromium browser we needed this attribute only once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Threads</head><p>AddressSanitizer is thread-safe. The shadow memory is modified only when the corresponding application memory is not accessible (inside malloc or free, during creation or destruction of a stack frame, during module initialization). All other accesses to the shadow memory are reads. The malloc and free functions use thread-local caches to avoid locking on every call (as most modern malloc implementations do). If the original program has a race between a memory access and deletion of that memory, AddressSanitizer may sometimes detect it as a use-after-free bug, but is not guaranteed to. Thread IDs are recorded for every malloc and free and are reported in error messages together with thread creation call stacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>We measured the performance of AddressSanitizer on C and C++ benchmarks from SPEC CPU2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28]</ref>. The measurements were done in 64-bit mode on an HP Z600 machine with 2 quad-core Intel Xeon E5620 CPUs and 24GB RAM. We compared the performance of instrumented binaries with the binaries built using the regular LLVM compiler (clang -O2). We used 32-byte redzones, disabled the stack unwinding during malloc and free and set the quarantine size to zero (see Section 4.3). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref> shows that the average slowdown on CPU2006 is 73%. The largest slowdown is seen on perlbench and xalancbmk (2.60x and 2.67x respectively). These two benchmarks are very malloc-intensive and make a huge number of 1-and 2-byte memory accesses (both benchmarks are text processing programs). We also measured AddressSanitizer performance when only writes are instrumented: the average slowdown is 26%. This mode could be used in performance-critical environments to find a subset of memory bugs. Three bugs were found in CPU2006: one stack and one global buffer overflow in h264ref, and a use-afterrealloc in perlbench.</p><p>We also evaluated the performance of different mapping Scale and Offset values (see Section 3.1). The Scale values greater than 3 produce slightly slower code on average (from 2% speedup to 15% slowdown compared to Scale=3). The memory footprint for Scale=4,5 is close to that of Scale=3. For values 6 and 7, the memory footprint is greater because larger redzones are required. Setting Offset to zero (which requires -fPIE/-pie) gives a small speedup, bringing the average slowdown on CPU2006 to 69%. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarizes the increase in memory usage (collected by reading the VmPeak field from /proc/self/status at process termination). The memory overhead comes mostly from the malloc redzones. The average memory usage increase is 3.37x. There is also a constant-size overhead for quarantine, which we did not count in the experiment. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> summarizes the stack size increase (VmStk field in /proc/self/status). Only 6 benchmarks had a noticeable stack size change and only 3 benchmarks had stack size increases over 10%.</p><p>The binary size increase on SPEC CPU2006 ranges from 1.5x to 3.2x, with an average of 2.5x.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Comparison</head><p>Comparing AddressSanitizer with other tools is tricky because other tools find different sets of bugs. Valgrind and Dr. Memory incur 20x and 10x slowdowns on CPU2006, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. But these tools detect a different set of bugs (in addition to out-of-bounds and use-after-free they detect uninitialized reads and memory leaks, but do not handle out-of-bounds for most stack variables and globals). Mudflap, probably the most similar tool to AddressSanitizer, has very unusual performance characteristics. According to our measurements, Mudflap's slowdown on CPU2006 ranges from 2x to 41x; several benchmarks fail with out-of-memory errors.</p><p>Debug malloc implementations that use CPU guard pages typically slow down only very malloc-intensive applications. Duma, the freely available guard page implementation for Linux, crashed on 12 out of 18 CPU2006 benchmarks with out-of-memory errors. No surprise: the Duma manual describes it as a "terrible memory hog". On the remaining 6 benchmarks it showed very small overhead (from -1% to 5%).</p><p>The overhead of the DieHarder debug malloc is very low, 20% on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>. However, on three mallocintensive benchmarks it is comparable with the overhead of AddressSanitizer: perlbench, 2x; omnetpp, 1.85x; xalancbmk, 1.75x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">AddressSanitizer Deployment</head><p>The Chromium open-source browser <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> has been regularly tested with AddressSanitizer since we released the tool in May 2011. In the first 10 months of testing the tool detected over 300 previously unknown bugs in the Chromium code and in third-party libraries. 210 bugs were heap-use-after-free, 73 were heap-buffer-overflow, 8 global-buffer-overflow, 7 stack-buffer-overflow and 1 memcpy parameter overlap. In 13 more cases AddressSanitizer triggered some other kind of program error (e.g., uninitialized memory read), but did not provide a meaningful error message.</p><p>The two major sources of bug reports in Chromium are regular runs of the existing unit tests and targeted random test generation (fuzzing). In either case the speed of the instrumented code is critical. For unit tests, the high speed allows the use of fewer machines to keep up with the source changes. For fuzzing, it allows running a random test in just a few seconds (since AddressSanitizer is implemented as compile-time instrumentation, it has no start-up penalty), and once a bug is found, minimize the test in reasonable time. A small number of bugs have been found by manually running the instrumented browser -which would not have been possible with a significantly slower tool.</p><p>Besides Chromium we have also tested a large amount of other code and found many bugs. As in Chromium, heap-use-after-free was the most frequent kind of bug; however stack-and global-buffer-overflow appeared more often than in Chromium. Several heap-use-afterfree bugs were detected in LLVM itself. We were notified about bugs found by AddressSanitizer in Firefox, Perl, Vim, and several other opensource projects 3 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Tuning Accuracy And Resource Usage</head><p>AddressSanitizer has three major controls that affect accuracy and resource usage.</p><p>Depth of stack unwinding (default: 30). On every call to malloc and free the tool needs to unwind the call stack so that error messages contain more information. This option affects the speed of the tool, especially if the tested application is malloc-intensive. It does not affect the memory footprint or the bug-finding ability, but short stack traces are often not enough to analyze an error message.</p><p>Quarantine size (default: 256MB). This value controls the ability to find heap-use-after-free bugs (see Section 3.5). It does not affect performance.</p><p>Size of the heap redzone (default: 128 bytes). This option affects the ability to find heap-buffer-overflow bugs (see Section 3.5). Large values may lead to significant slowdown and increased memory usage, especially if the tested program allocates many small chunks of heap memory. Since the redzone is used to store the malloc call stack, decreasing the redzone automatically decreases the maximal unwinding depth.</p><p>While testing Chromium we used the default values of these three parameters. Increasing any of them did not increase the bug-finding ability. While testing other software we sometimes had to use smaller redzone sizes (32 or 64 bytes) and/or completely disable stack unwinding to meet extreme memory and speed constraints. In environments with a small amount of RAM we used smaller quarantine sizes. All three values are controlled by an environment variable and can be set at process startup.</p><p>3 http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/FoundBugs</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Future Work</head><p>This section discusses improvements and further steps that could be taken with AddressSanitizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Compile-time Optimizations</head><p>It is not necessary to instrument every memory access in order to find all memory bugs. There is redundant instrumentation that can be eliminated, as shown in this example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">void inc(int *a) { (*a)++; }</formula><p>Here we have two memory accesses, one load and one store, but we need to instrument only the first one. This is the only compile-time optimization implemented in AddressSanitizer currently. Some other possible optimizations are described below. These optimizations apply only under certain conditions (e.g., there should be no non-pure function calls between the two accesses in the first example).</p><p>• Instrument only the first access:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">*a = ... if (...) *a = ...</formula><p>• Instrument only the second access (although this gives up the property of guaranteeing to report an error prior to the actual load or store taking place):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">if (...)</formula><p>*a = ... *a = ...</p><p>• Instrument only a <ref type="bibr">[0]</ref> and a[n-1]:</p><p>for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) a[i] = ...;</p><p>We already use this approach for instrumenting functions like memset, memcpy and similar. It may potentially miss some bugs if n is large.</p><p>• Combine two accesses into one:</p><p>struct { int a, b; } x; ... x.a = ...;</p><p>x.b = ...;</p><p>• Do not instrument accesses that can be statically proven to be correct: int x <ref type="bibr">[100]</ref>; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)</p><p>x[i] = ...;</p><p>• No point in instrumenting accesses to scalar globals: int glob; int get_glob() { return glob; }</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Handling Libraries</head><p>The current implementation of AddressSanitizer is based on compile-time instrumentation and thus does not handle system libraries (it does, however, handle some C library functions such as memset). For the open source libraries the best approach might be to create special instrumented builds. For the closed source libraries a combined static/dynamic instrumentation approach could be used. All available source code could be built with an AddressSanitizer-enabled compiler. Then, during execution, the closed-source libraries could be instrumented with a binary translation system (such as DynamoRIO <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6]</ref>). It is possible to implement AddressSanitizer using only run-time instrumentation but it will probably be slower due to binary translation overhead, including suboptimal register allocation. Besides, it is not clear how to implement redzones for stack objects using run-time instrumentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Hardware Support</head><p>The performance characteristics of AddressSanitizer allow for use in a wide range of situations. However, for the most performance-critical applications and for the cases where the binary size is important, the current overhead may be too restrictive. The instrumentation performed by AddressSanitizer (see Section 3.2) could be replaced by a single new hardware instruction checkN (e.g., "check4 Addr" for a 4-byte access). The checkN instruction with parameter Addr should be equivalent to ShadowAddr = (Addr &gt;&gt; Scale) + Offset; k = *ShadowAddr; if (k != 0 &amp;&amp; ((Addr &amp; 7) + N &gt; k) GenerateException();</p><p>The values of Offset and Scale could be stored in special registers and set at application startup. Such an instruction would improve performance by reducing the icache pressure, combining simple arithmetic operations, and achieving better branch prediction. It would also reduce the binary size significantly.</p><p>By default the checkN instruction could be a no-op and only enabled by a special CPU flag. This would allow to selectively test certain executions or even test long-lived processes for a fraction of their execution time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we presented AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector. AddressSanitizer finds out-of-bounds (for heap, stack, and globals) accesses and use-after-free bugs at the cost of 73% slowdown on average; the tool has no false positives.</p><p>AddressSanitizer uses shadow memory to provide accurate and immediate bug detection. The conventional wisdom is that shadow memory either incurs high overhead through multi-level mapping schemes or imposes prohibitive address space requirements by occupying a large contiguous region. Our novel shadow state encoding reduces our shadow space footprint enough that we can use a simple mapping, which can be implemented with low overhead.</p><p>The high speed provided by the tool allows the user to run more tests faster. The tool has been used to test the Chromium browser and has found over 300 real bugs in just 10 months, including some that could have potentially led to security vulnerabilities. AddressSanitizer users found bugs in Firefox, Perl, Vim and LLVM.</p><p>The instrumentation required for AddressSanitizer is simple enough to be implemented in a wide range of compilers, binary instrumentation systems, and even in hardware.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: AddressSanitizer memory mapping.</figDesc></figure>
