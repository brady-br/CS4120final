				<p>High accuracy scientific simulations on high performance computing (HPC) platforms generate large amounts of data. To allow data to be efficiently analyzed , simulation outputs need to be refactored, compressed , and properly mapped onto storage tiers. This paper presents Canopus, a progressive data management framework for storing and analyzing big scientific data. Canopus allows simulation results to be refactored into a much smaller dataset along with a series of deltas with fairly low overhead. Then, the refactored data are compressed , mapped, and written onto storage tiers. For data analytics, refactored data are selectively retrieved to restore data at a specific level of accuracy that satisfies analysis requirements. Canopus enables end users to make trade-offs between analysis speed and accuracy on-the-fly. Canopus is demonstrated and thoroughly evaluated using blob detection on fusion simulation data.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In 2015, the authors worked with a team of computational scientists from Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to conduct a hero fusion simulation on Titan <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, utilizing 300,000 cores to model the largest fusion reactor in the world. The fidelity and resolution of the simulation demanded a solution that could efficiently store and analyze 1 PB of new data per day. On Titan, we estimated that the I/O would take at least 5 hours to finish, which was deemed too expensive. On the other hand, the total capacity of one file system partition on Titan was 14 PB. With the data rate of 1 PB per day, the file system capacity would be quickly saturated in less than 14 days. Such a large amount of data posed a multitude of data management challenges. Neither the throughput nor the capacity could be sustained by the parallel file system on Titan at the time. This forced the fusion scientists to sacrifice the fidelity of the run in order to accomplish the science campaign in an acceptable time.</p><p>What fundamentally caused this analytics difficulty was that the numerical calculations in a large scientific simulation often used the highest possible accuracy in both spatial and temporal dimensions to minimize errors after a long iteration. This nevertheless leads to a higher data volume and velocity of simulation data that the downstream analytics may not be able to digest. Working with the fusion scientists and other Titan users, we have identified the following opportunities to tackle this challenge. First, scientists do not always require analytics be performed at the the same level of accuracy as the simulation, and a lower accuracy may suffice on a case-by-case basis. Second, the storage hierarchy is becoming increasingly deep with the emergence of new storage/memory technologies. Different storage tiers possess distinct I/O characteristics and constraints, and these need to be fully exploited to meet the performance and capacity requirements from data analytics.</p><p>To facilitate data analysis in an efficient and flexible manner, we design and implement Canopus, a data management middleware that can refactor the simulation results (via decimation) into a base dataset along with a series of deltas. The refactored data are further compressed and mapped to storage tiers. For post-run data analytics that may examine the data with some certain accuracy and performance requirements in mind, Canopus allows the base level and a selected subset of deltas to be retrieved to restore the target accuracy, which may or may not be the same as the full accuracy. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 1</ref> illustrates the Canopus workflow. For example, a simulation with a decimation ratio of 4 generates a base dataset L 4x that is 25% of the full accuracy size, along with delta <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> and delta f ull . In particular, delta <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> is the difference between L 4x and L 2x (i.e., data generated with the decimation ratio of 2), and delta f ull is the difference between L 2x and L f ull (i.e., the full accuracy data). These datasets can be further compressed to L c 4x , delta c 2x , delta c f ull and mapped onto the following storage tiers, ST 1 (the fastest but the smallest in capacity, e.g., non-volatile memory (NVRAM)), ST 2 (slower base + delta <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> base + delta <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> + delta full</p></div>

Next, data analytics has three options to examine the data: <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>   <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> + delta f ull = L f ull . These options allow users to progressively augment the data accuracy by fetching the deltas level by level on-the-fly.</p><p>In this paper, we describe our efforts in implementing the progressive factoring and data exploration. The functionalities are demonstrated in the blob detection use case in fusion XGC1 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> diagnostic data, and we are particularly interested in examining the dpot variable, which is a 2D scalar field organized in planes in a fusion reactor. The experiments were conducted on Titan where we utilized DRAM-backed tmpfs and the Lustre parallel file system to build a 2-tier storage hierarchy for write and read. Overall this paper makes the following contributions:</p><p>• We design and implement Canopus, a data management framework that allows simulation data to be refactored so that users can perform exploratory data analysis progressively. Canopus utilizes the mesh decimation and floating-point compression algorithms to mitigate storage footprints and expedite data analytics on simulation results. It enables scientists to define and control data analysis according to their data collection practices and analysis needs.</p><p>• Canopus refactors and maps data to proper storage tiers, taking advantage of the capacity and performance characteristics of each tier. The co-design of analytics and storage provides a new data management paradigm in HPC environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data Refactoring</head><p>In order to provide a range of accuracies to users, Canopus refactors simulation data into a base low accuracy dataset along with a series of deltas. The resulting data are then placed onto storage tiers, with the base dataset</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Mesh (Full) Mesh (4x reduction) Full L4x delta full delta 2x</formula><p>Delta calculation Decimation Original R R <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Data refactoring. Note x-and y-axis are location coordinates within a plane.</p><p>being placed onto a high storage tier (that can accommodate the base data), and the deltas being placed onto low storage tiers. Since the refactoring is performed during the execution of a simulation over a large number of computing cores, refactoring including compression itself needs to be relatively cheap, compared to the total simulation time. Canopus specifically targets the applications in which the simulation results need to be written once but will be analyzed a number of times, which is typical for scientific data analysis (e.g., for parameter sensitivity study). Therefore, the new functions and/or performance advantages in data retrieval are our major focus here.</p><p>Refactoring. In general, Canopus supports various approaches to refactoring data, including byte splitting, block splitting, mesh decimation. In this paper, we choose the mesh decimation to demonstrate the Canopus framework, because 1) the majority of the scientific simulations use mesh based data models; 2) mesh decimation enables a wide range of accuracies, as compared to other methods; and 3) it can generate a lower accuracy that is complete in geometry, and can be directly acted upon by analytics. Overall the data refactoring is done iteratively and each iteration consists of two key steps: mesh decimation and delta calculation ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). 1) Mesh decimation. Canopus can decimate data efficiently for both structured and unstructured meshes. It is less involved to decimate a structured mesh since its geometry (nodes and their connectivities) is rather simple. For unstructured meshes, Canopus adopts edge collapsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5]</ref> to decimate unstructured meshes from level l to level l + 1. To this end, we first insert all edges of a mesh into a priority queue. The priority of an edge is set as the distance between its two vertices. Data decimation is conducted by successively cutting the edge with the lowest priority from the mesh until the decimation ratio is reached. Namely the shortest edge, E l i, j between vertex V l i and V l j at level l, will be removed from the mesh. Next, a new vertex, V l+1  </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i = NewVertex(V l i ,V l j ), V l+1 i V l+1 j V l+1 k V l w V l x V l y V l z</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">= (V l i +V l j )/2.</formula><p>The time complexity of decimation is dominated by the cost of the insert operation in a priority queue, which is typically O(logN). Note that the size of the decimated data (without compression) equals the size of the original data divided by the decimation ratio (greater than 1), and the mesh decimation can be done in embarrassingly parallel, since it can be done locally without requiring communications with others.</p><p>2) Delta calculation. After decimation, instead of placing the original data on storage, Canopus generates the delta, which is the difference between the pre-and post-decimation data. The reason is that we notice in the fusion datasets, the delta is much smoother than the original data <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>), and can be fairly well compressed by ZFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, which exploits the local smoothness to achieve a high compression ratio. For data analytics that needs to perform at the original accuracy, the original data can be restored from the post-decimation data and the deltas. In the storage hierarchy, the post-decimation data is typically stored in a high tier, and the delta is stored in a low tier (due to its larger size). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the delta calculation in a triangular mesh.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">delta l n = F(V l n ) − α · F(V l+1 i ) − β · F(V l+1 j ) − γ · F(V l+1 k )</formula><p>, where α + β + γ = 1, n ∈ {w, x, y, z}. And F(·) is a function that maps V l i to its field value (e.g., dpot). For simplicity, we set α = β = γ = 1/3. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> evaluates the refactoring cost under various system setups, and in particular <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4(a)</ref> shows the storage-to-compute trend since 2009 for leadership class HPC systems in the U.S.. Overall, the trend is that compute is becoming cheaper and the gap between compute and storage has widened sharply since 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  4(b)</ref> shows the time breakdown of writing data out using Canopus, including the time spent on decimation, the time spent on calculating the delta between two adjacent levels along with compression using ZFP, and the time spent on I/O, under various storage-to-compute capabilities, namely, high (i.e., compute-bound), medium, and low (i.e., I/O-bound). For the compute-bound, medium, and I/O-bound scenario, we assign 32, 128, 512 cores per storage target, respectively. In particular, the medium case is chosen to reflect the capabilities of Titian which has 300,000 core with 2,016 (for two partitions) storage targets. As the compute becomes increasingly powerful as compared to the I/O, decimation and delta calculation becomes cheaper, compared to the cost of I/O.</p><p>Compression. The refactored data can be further compressed to reduce the storage cost, in terms of both capacity and data movement cost. As of now, Canopus has integrated ZFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, a state-of-the-art floating-point data compressor, to perform compression. It exploits the local smoothness that typically exists between neighboring data elements, and aggressively reduces data using both lossy and lossless compressions. Other compression libraries such as SZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> and FPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> can also be integrated into Canopus and these are still work in progress. As <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows, the delta (e.g., delta <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> ) calculated between adjacent levels exhibits a much higher smoothness than directly compressing the intermediate decimation results (e.g., L 4x ). Essentially Canopus serves as a pre-conditioner that further prepares the data for compression and improves ZFP performance.</p><p>Data Placement. The compressed base data and deltas are then placed onto storage tiers. The base data can be decimated to the point that it is small enough to fit into a high tier, e.g., NVRAM, and the additional deltas can be placed onto lower tiers that have larger capacities. Writing data out efficiently is done by utilizing ADIOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>, which provides a layer of abstraction that hides the storage complexities away from applications. An I/O transport that best utilizes a specific storage tier is selected and configured in an external XML configuration. As aforementioned, we built up a 2-tier storage comprised of DRAM-backed tmpfs and the Lustre parallel file system on Titan, and the refactored data is written in parallel from each core, with the high tier being written first followed by the low tier. The I/O time measured here is the total time spent on writing both tiers. This paper assumes once data is placed, there is no further data migration/eviction. However, in reality since the capacity of each tier is shared by users, data migration/eviction is needed to ensure the capacity is best utilized, and this is left for future study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Progressive Data Exploration</head><p>Canopus supports progressive data explorations on floating-point data for both structured and unstructured meshes. Data analysis starts from the lowest accuracy with the base dataset, which is previously placed on a high storage tier. If the accuracy suffices and the outcome of data analytics is satisfactory, the data exploration ends here. Otherwise, data with the next level of accuracy is constructed by putting together the current accuracy and the associated delta(s) on lower tiers <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). This step is repeated until the data accuracy satisfies the users. Canopus takes advantage of storage characteristics, and maps refactored data to proper storage tiers. The base dataset is small in size and is stored on a high storage tier to enable fast data exploration (e.g., data inspection). Meanwhile, the large capacity of a low tier is utilized to accommodate high accuracy data. Another key benefit of Canopus is that the initial analysis on the low accuracy data can provide guidance to the subsequent data explorations, and facilitate retrieving a subset (as opposed to the full set) of the high accuracy data, thus reducing the amount of data retrieved from slow tiers.</p><p>I/O and Decompression. Canopus uses the ADIOS read API to retrieve the refactored data. ADIOS provides a metadata-rich binary-packed data format, and the complexity of retrieving data across storage tiers is considerably reduced. The global metadata in ADIOS maintains the location of the refactored data, and the users can get the attributes of the refactored data via the ADIOS query interface, e.g., using adios inq var(file handle, "dpot"). The retrieved data is then decompressed using ZFP.</p><p>Restoration. Canopus subsequently restores data to the desired level of accuracy by applying a set of deltas to the base data. Namely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">F(V l n ) = α · F(V l+1 i ) + β · F(V l+1 j )+γ ·F(V l+1 k )+delta l n ,</formula><p>where α +β +γ = 1, n ∈ {w, x, y, z}. The complexity of restoration is O(n), where n is the number of vertices at level l. One critical step in restoration is to identify the set of vertices that fall into a triangle &lt; V l+1 i , V l+1 j , V l+1 k &gt; at level l + 1. The brute force approach that checks whether V l n falls into this triangle can be expensive due to the potential large number of vertices at level l and triangles at level l + 1 in the mesh. To this end, Canopus stores the mapping between V l n and the triangle during the refactoring phase, and the mapping information can be subsequently used to accelerate data restoration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(a) measures the end-to-end time of blob detection pipeline, which consists of I/O, decompression, restoration, and blob detection phases. Without any surprise, I/O is the major bottleneck in this analytics pipeline, with the rest incurring very low overhead. The baseline case in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> is the time spent on analyzing the data with the highest accuracy on the Lustre paralell file system. Decompression and restoration are not needed in this case. For other test cases, each of them measures the amount of time spent on obtaining the next level of accuracy, and performing blob detection on the  restored data. For example, at the decimation ratio of 4, the total time spent, approximately 0.82 seconds, is the time to retrieve and decompress L 4x (25% of the original data size) and delta <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> , restore L 2x (50% of the original data size) , and perform blob detection on L <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure  5</ref>(a) demonstrates that if data of a lower accuracy can satisfy the analysis requirement, the analysis time can be significant reduced. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>(b) evaluates the worst case scenario in Canopus where data analysis requires the full accuracy data. Still, Canopus can restore the full accuracy data and reduce the data analysis time by up to 50% due to the I/O savings from fully utilizing the storage hierarchy and data pre-conditioning for ZFP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Impact on Data Analytics</head><p>Canopus allows users to select the level of accuracy that is sufficient for one's scientific discovery. The choice of accuracy is mostly driven by two questions: How much faster data analytics can run with the reduced accuracy, and what is the impact of reduced accuracy on data analytics? This section focuses on discussing the second question. The data analytics we demonstrate is blob detection in fusion XGC1 diagnostic data, from which fusion scientists examine the electrostatic potential (dpot) in a fusion device and study the trajectory of high energy particles. This is critical to the understanding of instabilities that can build up in fusion reactors. Herein, we use the blob detection function in OpenCV, an open source computer vision library, to identify areas with high field potentials in a 2D plane of dpot data, and we test the following parameters of blob detection: Config1: &lt; minT hreshold = 10, maxT hreshold = 200, minArea = 100 &gt;; Config2: &lt; minT hreshold = 150, maxT hreshold = 200, minArea = 100 &gt;; Config3: &lt; minT hreshold = 10, maxT hreshold = 200, minArea = 200 &gt; <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> illustrates the blob detection results under various accuracy levels: the full accuracy, L <ref type="bibr">2x</ref> , and L 4x . The circled areas are identified as high energy blobs. As the data accuracy decreases, the number of blobs captured decreases. However, we notice that the blobs tend to expand first and then disappear once the potential falls below a certain threshold. This is caused by the averaging effect of the edge collapsing technique that Cano-  pus employs to decimate unstructured mesh. This is evidenced by the increased blob diameter and area size in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>(b) and (c), and as such, a cluster of blobs may overlap and merge. Nevertheless, in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> most blobs in the full accuracy data can still be detected in a moderately reduced accuracy, and blobs detected in a low accuracy data have a high overlap ratio with the blobs detected in the full accuracy data <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 7(d)</ref>). We define two blobs are overlapped if the distance between two blob centers is less than the sum of the two individual radiuses. The high overlap ratio suggests that the blobs detected in the low accuracy data can still capture the areas with high field potential. If a lower accuracy can not satisfy the scientific requirements, a higher accuracy data can always be further restored and processed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Data management is one of the top ten research exascale challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. Data reduction methods preserving the capability for exploratory analysis are desired. Similar efforts have been made to enable efficient queries directly on compressed database storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>. A challenge for HPC storage is to develop a flexible data reduction mechanism that supports scientist-defined analysis. Due to the relatively low compression ratios, lossless compression algorithms have limited impact on reducing data footprints. Laney et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> demonstrated that lossy compression mechanisms could achieve a 3 to 5X reduction ratio without causing significant changes to important physical quantities. ZFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> and SZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> have been implemented to achieve high reduction ratio on floating-point data. Mesh compression algorithms reduce both geometry data and connectivity data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. To enable multi-accuracy analysis, progressive mesh compression has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. In other directions, Migratory Compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> recognizes data chunk similarities, and relocates similar chunks together to improve data compressibility. Simulation-time data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>, which tries to perform as much in-memory analysis as possible, has roused research interests.</p><p>System level optimizations can also expedite data analysis. SDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> reorganizes data to match the read patterns so as to accelerate analytical tasks. BurstFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> utilizes high-performance burst buffers to support scalable and efficient aggregation of I/O bandwidth, accelerating read operations of analytical tasks. ADIOS middleware <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> enables us to design and implement Canopus, a data refactoring framework which employs mesh compression and floating-point compression algorithms to achieve a high data reduction ratio without sacrificing the analyzability of the data. The approach of Canopus also shares some similarities with the concept of lineage by trading compute for I/O <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23]</ref>. The co-design of data compression, storage, and analysis over mesh-based data differentiates Canopus from existing work.</p></div>
