			<abstract>
				<p>Click-jacking protection on the modern Web is commonly enforced via client-side security mechanisms for framing control, like the X-Frame-Options header (XFO) and Content Security Policy (CSP). Though these client-side security mechanisms are certainly useful and successful, delegating protection to web browsers opens room for inconsistencies in the security guarantees offered to users of different browsers. In particular, inconsistencies might arise due to the lack of support for CSP and the different implementations of the un-derspecified XFO header. In this paper, we formally study the problem of inconsistencies in framing control policies across different browsers and we implement an automated policy analyzer based on our theory, which we use to assess the state of click-jacking protection on the Web. Our analysis shows that 10% of the (distinct) framing control policies in the wild are inconsistent and most often do not provide any level of protection to at least one browser. We thus propose recommendations for web developers and browser vendors to mitigate this issue. Finally, we design and implement a server-side proxy to retrofit security in web applications.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Web is the largest distributed system in the world, and it boasts an incredible variety and complexity. Unfortunately, complexity is where attackers lurk. To assist developers in securing their applications, the Web platform has evolved to support more and more server-sent, yet client-enforced security mechanisms. This approach is appealing because it offers uniform and well-thought defenses to as many Web developers as possible. Examples of popular client-side security mechanisms include Content Security Policy (CSP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, cookie security attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and HSTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Although client-side security mechanisms are undoubtedly useful and successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, delegating protection to Web browsers might introduce inconsistencies in the security guarantees offered to users of different browsers. The most obvious case is when legacy browsers access Web applications, but problems might also arise when the same defense is implemented differently across modern browsers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In this paper, we are concerned about inconsistencies in framing control, a cornerstone of Web application security, which pioneered the adoption of client-side security mechanisms.</p><p>Framing control constrains the inclusion of Web content inside iframes (sub-documents) opened by malicious pages and it is particularly useful to prevent click-jacking attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The original defense against click-jacking back in the days was the use of JavaScript-based frame busters. These scripts, placed in pages for which framing should be forbidden, merely checked conditions like self == top to assess whether they were loaded in the top-most frame. If not, they would navigate the top frame away. Unfortunately, researchers showed that this solution was often ineffective <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In 2009, Internet Explorer introduced the X-Frame-Options header (XFO) as a simple, browser-based mechanism to control framing without relying on JavaScript. This header gained extensive popularity and was quickly adopted by all the other major browsers. Unfortunately, since XFO was not standardized a priori, different browser vendors provided different implementations, leading to differing support of its directives and attacks like double framing in some browsers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In 2014, the second iteration of the CSP specification introduced the frame-ancestors directive to control framing, with the goal of obsoleting XFO and to offer a comprehensive, uniform protection mechanism for all CSP-compliant browsers.</p><p>The way in which the Web platform evolved hints at the fact that the state of click-jacking protection on the Web is brittle. Most browsers provide two different defenses in the form of XFO and CSP, possibly with different implementations, and developers may choose to use any of these two mechanisms, or a combination thereof, to protect their Web applications. Given such complexity and the diverse levels of support for framing control, this potentially gives rise to inconsistencies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the differing behavior of major browsers and introduce and apply a simple formal framework to study the problem in the wild.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USENIX Association 29th USENIX Security Symposium 683</head><p>Contributions. We make the following contributions:</p><p>1. we introduce a formal framework designed to rigorously study the problem of inconsistencies in framing control, based on existing work on the CSP semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We use this framework to formalize the notion of policy consistency and to observe that not every inconsistency is equally dangerous. We thus propose more relaxed definitions which admit limited types of inconsistencies and might be justified by how the Web platform has been evolving (Section 3);</p><p>2. we develop a policy analyzer (dubbed FRAMECHECK) based on the proposed theory, which enables an automated security assessment of the state of click-jacking protection on a given Web page. Our implementation leverages a comprehensive set of test cases designed to understand how existing browsers implement the loosely specified XFO header. The test cases are of independent interest since they highlight potentially dangerous practices in major browsers (Section 4);</p><p>3. we run FRAMECHECK on policies collected from 10,000 popular websites from the Tranco list <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and we assess their effectiveness. Our experiments show that 10% of the (de-duplicated) policies are inconsistent. Hence we carry out a systematic analysis of the main causes of inconsistency and their practical import. We also discuss the impact of the selected browsers on the results of our study, reasoning on the road forward for click-jacking protection (Section 5);</p><p>4. we present recommendations for developers and browser vendors to mitigate the dangers of the framing control inconsistencies that are currently affecting the Web. We also design and implement a server-side proxy to retrofit security in existing Web applications, which we release as open-source software (Section 6).</p><p>Artifact Availability. In the interest of open science, we make both our server-side proxy and the FRAMECHECK core available online. 1,2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>In this section, we review framing-based attacks and the most popular client-side defense mechanisms against them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Framing-based Attacks</head><p>The nature of HTML and CSS allows the developers of a Web site fine-grained control over how elements are placed and shown in the browser. This feature, which is one of the core pillars of the Web's success, can, however, be abused by attackers to their advantage. In particular, an attacker can trick their victims into clicking elements in another Web application. One popular example is the so-called like-jacking attack on social networks. Here, an attacker creates a page with an element a user is likely to click, e.g., a button promising some premium content. Then, the attacker adds an iframe pointing to a page with a Like button (e.g., from Facebook) at the same coordinates, and use CSS to make the iframe fully transparent. When the user tries to click the button for the premium content, she unknowingly clicks into the frame, inadvertently invoking the like functionality. In general, we refer to such attacks where the adversary lures the victim into unknowingly clicking a link on a different page as click-jacking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">X-Frame-Options</head><p>Starting from 2009, browser vendors picked up on the increasing danger of click-jacking and similar attacks, and Internet Explorer was the first browser to implement the so-called X-Frame-Options (XFO) header <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This header allows a site to control which other origins may frame it. At that time, Firefox and Internet Explorer supported three different directives for the XFO header: SAMEORIGIN to allow framing only from pages with the same origin (i.e., protocol, host, and port), ALLOW-FROM origin to selectively allow framing from a single origin or DENY to block framing completely. Importantly, although an XFO specification exists in the form of RFC 7034 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, that specification was written after various browsers had implemented XFO and notes that "not all browsers implement X-Frame-Options in exactly the same way, which can lead to unintended results". In particular, the ALLOW-FROM directive is not universally supported by all browsers: most importantly, all Chromium derivates do not understand this directive. Additionally, browsers might implement SAMEORIGIN (and ALLOW-FROM) differently because the origin check for framing can be performed in different ways. According to the specification, the check can be based "on the origin of the framed page and the top-level browsing context", on "the framed page and the framing page", or on "the whole chain of nested frames in between". When the XFO specification was originally written, the first practice was the most common, yet such implementation is potentially insecure because it opens the way to double framing attacks, where the attacker relies on multiple nested frames to circumvent existing defense mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Overall, we find that XFO is indeed inconsistently implemented across browsers. We dive deeper into the actual inconsistencies and their impact in Section 4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Content Security Policy</head><p>Given the problems of the underspecified XFO header, the Web security community proposed to incorporate framing control into Content Security Policy (CSP). While initially meant as a means of mitigating injection attacks, CSP nowadays offers support for framing control and TLS enforcement as well. As a recent study has shown, CSP is equally widely used for these use cases as it is for its original purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, framing control in CSP can be enforced through the frame-ancestors directive. This solution has a clear advantage over XFO due to its standardized support and additional expressiveness. First, as the name suggests, the frame-ancestors directive performs the origin check for framing based on the whole chain of nested frames (ancestors) between the top-level browsing context and the framed page, which offers the strongest security guarantees by ruling out double framing. Moreover, CSP is strictly more expressive than XFO, since it can take advantage of the full CSP syntax, which allows one to whitelist an arbitrary (possibly empty) list of origins. For example, the DENY directive of XFO can be simulated by setting the frame-ancestors directive to 'none', while the SAMEORIGIN directive can be simulated by setting it to 'self'. Even better, CSP can be easily used to whitelist all subdomains of given domains, e.g., frame-ancestors *.foo.com *.bar.com, which cannot be expressed through XFO. Hence, administrators have an easier job at maintaining a whitelist of sites through CSP; achieving the same through XFO is only possible by checking the Referer header of incoming HTTP requests. This header is sent by browsers and indicates the document which initiated the loading of a specific resource (in this case, an iframe). Hence, this can be combined with server-side logic to check the transmitted header against a whitelist, and respond with a corresponding ALLOW-FROM header. We refer to this mechanism as Referer sniffing.</p><p>In this paper, we refer to browsers supporting framing control via CSP as modern browsers; we deem all the other browsers as legacy. According to the CSP specification, modern browsers must ignore the XFO headers in the presence of a CSP, which includes a frame-ancestors directive. At the same time, however, XFO is still the only way for a site to control framing in legacy browsers. Given the difference in expressiveness between the two types of security mechanisms, this can cause inconsistencies when visiting the same page with different browsers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Formal Framework</head><p>In this section, we lay the theoretical grounds for our research by formalizing the notion of policy consistency. We then observe that not every inconsistency is equally dangerous and propose more relaxed definitions which admit limited types of inconsistencies. We also argue why these definitions are of practical interest by taking into account the current state of the Web platform and its evolution.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Syntax of CoreCSP</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Policy Semantics</head><p>Since CSP is more expressive than XFO, it is straightforward to translate every XFO policy into an equivalent CSP policy. Hence, we can define the semantics of every framing control policy on top of the CoreCSP framework, which provides a simple denotational semantics for the content restriction fragment of CSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In particular, one can interpret the set of origins from which framing is allowed using source expressions, i.e., a sort of regular expressions representing a set of origins. The semantics of a framing control policy is then given by a directive value, i.e., a set of source expressions defining the origins where framing is allowed. The productions in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> define the main syntactic categories of CoreCSP used in the present section. Note that, though relatively close to the original CSP syntax, CoreCSP abstracts from several details, which can still be easily modeled. For example, the 'none' source expression of CSP is represented by the directive value / 0 (framing is not allowed anywhere). To understand how the CoreCSP denotational semantics is defined, assume that http://www.foo.com deploys the following CSP:</p><p>frame-ancestors *.foo.com https://* Since the protected page is served over HTTP, the semantics of the policy is formalized by the directive value {(http, * .foo.com), (https, * )}. However, note that this assumes the use of a modern browser since any legacy browser which does not support CSP will ignore the policy and enforce no framing restriction. This can be modeled by giving the semantics of the policy in terms of the more liberal directive value {(http, *), (https, * )}.</p><p>More generally, since the same policy might be enforced differently by different browsers and the same Web page may also send different policies to different user agents, we let w b stand for the directive value representing the framing restrictions enforced on the page w by the browser b. We postpone to Section 4 the definition of · · for the browsers of interest and develop a general theory in the present section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Formal Definitions</head><p>We build on CoreCSP because directive values can be ordered by a relation such that v 1 v 2 if and only if the set of origins represented by v 1 is contained in the set of origins represented by v 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. CoreCSP allows us to readily formalize the intuition of a consistent policy, i.e., a policy that enforces the same restrictions across all browsers.</p><p>Definition 1 (Consistent Policy). The policy of the Web page w is consistent for the set of browsers B if and only if, for all b 1 , b 2 ∈ B, we have w b 1 w b 2 and w b 2 w b 1 .</p><p>Example 1. Consider a Web site which only relies on XFO for framing control, specifying the policy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ALLOW-FROM https://www.example.com</formula><p>This policy is inconsistent, because it restricts framing in Edge, but leaves Chrome users completely unprotected. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> To improve protection, the Web site might then additionally specify a CSP of the following form:</p><p>frame-ancestors https://www.example.com</p><p>The revised framing control policy is consistent for Edge and Chrome since CSP takes precedence over XFO. Hence, the users of these two browsers are equally protected.</p><p>Though consistency is undoubtedly a desirable property of policies, there might be practical reasons why real-world framing control policies are inconsistent. In particular, the limited expressiveness of XFO complicates the deployment of useful policies, which instead are trivial to specify using CSP, e.g., enabling framing from multiple origins or arbitrary subdomains of a trusted domain. Operators can work around this limitation by shipping different ALLOW-FROM directives to different pages through Referer sniffing, yet this requires the implementation of additional logic. We thus see pragmatic reasons why XFO and CSP headers might contain mismatches leading to inconsistencies, but (luckily) we also notice that not all the inconsistencies are equally dangerous. We provide an example below.</p><p>Example 2. Assume that https://www.example.com only relies on CSP for framing control, specifying the policy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">frame-ancestors https://*.example.com</formula><p>This policy is inconsistent, because it restricts framing in Chrome, but does not protect the users of legacy browsers without CSP support. To improve protection, the Web site might then additionally specify an XFO policy of the form:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAMEORIGIN</head><p>The revised policy is still inconsistent, yet it provides tighter security than the original one and is straightforward to deploy, so it might be more appealing for Web developers. Note that since the XFO policy is less permissive than the CSP policy, this might lead to compatibility issues in legacy browsers, e.g., if framing is required from https://mail.example.com, yet users of such browsers are protected against click-jacking.</p><p>By elaborating on the previous example, we identify a new class of policies that has a useful property: legacy browsers are all in agreement on how the policy should be enforced, all modern browsers also share the same policy interpretation, but legacy browsers might be more conservative than modern browsers. This ensures that users of legacy browsers are protected and that no inconsistency arises among users of modern browsers, yet users of legacy browsers might be affected by compatibility issues. Formally, this is formulated by the following definition.</p><p>Definition 2 (Security-Oriented Policy). The policy of the Web page w is security-oriented for the set of browsers B if and only if it is possible to partition B in two sets B l , B m such that all these properties hold true:</p><p>• B l only includes legacy browsers and B m only includes modern browsers;</p><p>• the policy of w is consistent for both B l and B m ;</p><p>• for all b 1 ∈ B l and b 2 ∈ B m we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">w b 1 w b 2 .</formula><p>The last class of policies we consider still arises from the expressiveness gap between XFO and CSP yet makes the opposite choice of security-oriented policies: while it is still true that legacy browsers all give the same semantics to the policy, as well as modern browsers, the policy interpretation given by legacy browsers might be more liberal than one of the modern browsers. This ensures that users of legacy browsers can access the Web application without compatibility issues and that no inconsistency arises among users of modern browsers. Nevertheless, users of legacy browsers might be left unprotected.</p><p>Definition 3 (Compatibility-Oriented Policy). The policy of the Web page w is compatibility-oriented for the set of browsers B if and only if it is possible to partition B in two sets B l , B m such that all these properties hold true:</p><p>• B l only includes legacy browsers and B m only includes modern browsers;</p><p>• the policy of w is consistent for both B l and B m ;</p><p>• for all b 1 ∈ B l and b 2 ∈ B m we have w b 2 w b 1 .</p><p>Example 3. The original policy of Example 2 is inconsistent, yet compatibility-oriented. It is an insecure policy, but it might be a plausible choice for Web developers who are particularly concerned about compatibility with legacy browsers not supporting CSP, where no restriction is actually enforced. Instead, the original policy of Example 1 is not even compatibilityoriented, since two modern browsers like Chrome and Edge give different interpretations to the policy, due to Chrome's lack of support for ALLOW-FROM.</p><p>To summarize, we argue that consistency is the most desirable property for framing control policies since it implies the same policy interpretation in all browsers. Security-oriented policies can offer a proper level of protection on legacy browsers but might introduce compatibility issues with them. Compatibility-oriented policies might sacrifice protection on legacy browsers, but are backward compatible with them and thus potentially appealing to Web developers. Observe that a policy is consistent if and only if it is both security-oriented and compatibility-oriented.</p><p>Inconsistent policies which are neither security-oriented nor compatibility-oriented are generally hard to justify as correct because they fall in one of the following cases:</p><p>• two legacy browsers interpret the policy differently;</p><p>• two modern browsers interpret the policy differently;</p><p>• none of the above is true, yet legacy browsers and modern browsers give two incomparable interpretations of the same policy.</p><p>We refer to such policies as unduly inconsistent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Policy Analyzer</head><p>We designed and implemented FRAMECHECK, an automated analyzer of framing control policies based on our theory. Given a URL to analyze, FRAMECHECK produces a security report on its state of click-jacking protection. We explain the details of the analyzer in the rest of this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">FRAMECHECK Description</head><p>Our tool is parametric with respect to a set of browsers B.</p><p>Each browser b ∈ B is characterized by two ingredients:</p><p>1. its user-agent string UA b , defining how the browser presents itself to Web applications;</p><p>2. the semantics · b , expressed as a function translating a list of HTTP headers into a directive value of CoreCSP.</p><p>The user-agent string UA b can be easily found by inspecting the HTTP requests sent by the browser, e.g., using the developers' tools. At the same time, the semantics · b can be identified either by manual source code inspection (in the case of open-source browsers) or by reverse-engineering. Our implementation supports the 10 most popular browsers according to data from Can I Use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> For each browser, we downloaded the latest available version with at least 1% of market share <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and we reverse-engineered its semantics through an exhaustive set of test cases (see Section 4.2). The  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Browsers considered in the present study set of browsers under study is shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: only two browsers do not support framing control via CSP, i.e., Internet Explorer and Opera Mini, which we deem as legacy. Note that, according to Can I Use, Opera Mini does not support any mechanism for framing control. However, we installed the latest available version from the Google Play Store, and, according to our tests, Opera Mini, in fact, supports XFO. Given a Web page w to analyse, FRAMECHECK first accesses w once for each b ∈ B, sending the corresponding user-agent string UA b . Since w may redirect requests from different browsers to different landing pages, e.g., to provide a mobile-friendly variant of the page, this process eventually identifies a set of pairs of the form (B i , w i ), where B i ⊆ B and w i is the landing page of w for each b j ∈ B i . For each identified pair (B i , w i ), FRAMECHECK computes w i b j for each b j ∈ B i and produces a security report on policy consistency based on the definitions in Section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Test Cases</head><p>In total, we developed more than 40 test cases to reconstruct the semantics of the underspecified XFO header in our set of browsers. We designed the test cases through a careful analysis of the XFO specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and a preliminary inspection of a large set of framing control policies collected in the wild by a simple crawler. Hence, the test cases are not esoteric examples of problems that might possibly arise in theory, but rather represent classes of potentially ambiguous policies that we observed in practice. We report below on the most interesting findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Support for ALLOW-FROM</head><p>Though it is widely known that Chrome does not support ALLOW-FROM, it turns out that only 3 out of 10 browsers actually support this XFO directive: Edge, Firefox <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and Internet Explorer. This means that every Web page which adopts the ALLOW-FROM directive, but does not deploy a corresponding CSP, implements inconsistent protection against click-jacking and leaves (at least) 7 browsers unprotected.</p><p>We also tested what happens when the ALLOW-FROM directive is not followed by a valid serialized origin (e.g., https://example.com), as mandated by the XFO specification. In all the cases we tested, the browser implementations were conservative and denied framing, thus behaving as in the case of the DENY directive. There is one exception to this rule, though: Edge also supports the use of ALLOW-FROM with a hostname like example.com (without scheme). The corresponding interpretation is the following: if the policy is applied to an HTTP page, framing is allowed from example.com over both HTTP and HTTPS; if instead, the policy is applied to an HTTPS page, framing is only allowed from https://example.com. This interpretation is sensible from a security perspective because it mimics the behavior of source expressions in the CSP specification. However, it is worth noting that this introduces room for inconsistencies with other browsers, where framing is denied if the provided value is not a proper origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Support for Multiple Headers</head><p>When the same Web page sends multiple XFO headers, most of the tested browsers simultaneously enforce all of them: this is the case for 7 out of 10 browsers. Unfortunately, we observed that Edge, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini only enforce the first header and discard the other ones, which might lead to inconsistencies. For example, consider the following two headers:</p><p>X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN X-Frame-Options: DENY This policy prevents framing in most browsers, since two directives are simultaneously enforced, and one of them denies framing. However, this policy allows same-origin framing in Edge, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini. Observe that this policy would not have been inconsistent if the two headers had been swapped.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Parsing of Header Values</head><p>The HTTP protocol specification in RFC 7230 mandates that it must be possible to replace multiple headers with the same name with a single header that includes a comma-separated list of the header values <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, the standard implies that browsers must be able to handle headers of the following form correctly:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, DENY</head><p>This policy prevents framing in most browsers since it is interpreted as two headers, one of which denies framing (see above). However, we discovered unexpected behaviors in 3 browsers: Edge, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini. In particular, we observed that these browsers do not split the header value on commas and rather parse the list as a single value, which is interpreted as a non-existing directive, i.e., not enforcing any framing restriction. This also happens when the same directive is repeated multiple times, such as in the case of DENY, DENY. This behavior has a particularly subtle implication on the interpretation of policies like:</p><p>X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM &lt;orig1&gt;, &lt;orig2&gt;</p><p>Firefox parses this policy as two separate headers, one allowing framing from the first origin and the other one containing an incorrect value, which does not enforce any framing restriction: as a result, framing is only allowed from the first origin. Internet Explorer, instead, blocks every form of framing, since ALLOW-FROM is not set to a serialized origin. Remarkably, none of these two interpretations matches what the Web developer likely had in mind, i.e., whitelisting two different origins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Double Framing Protection</head><p>Finally, we observed that most browsers implement XFO in a way that is robust against double framing attacks. This shows that current implementation practices had improved since the original XFO specification when all browsers used to perform origin checks for framing based on the top-level browsing context alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, there are still 3 browsers that are susceptible to double framing attacks: Edge, Internet Explorer, and UC Browser.</p><p>In the rest of the paper, we do not consider inconsistencies arising from double framing, because otherwise even trivial XFO policies like SAMEORIGIN would be considered inconsistent and bias our study. This also implies that we do not need to take the full browsing context into account when defining the semantics of framing control policies in our framework, which is useful to keep the presentation simple.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">Summary</head><p>The summary of our analysis is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>. Based on our extensive set of test cases, we identified 6 different semantics across the 10 browsers we considered, without counting the unexpected support for hostnames in ALLOW-FROM implemented in Edge: this means that the room for inconsistent click-jacking protection is significant. Out of the 10 tested browsers, Firefox 69 is the only one that faithfully implements the specifications we checked, while Opera Mini offers little to no protection against click-jacking, because it does not implement CSP, it does not support ALLOW-FROM, and even basic XFO directives like SAMEORIGIN and DENY can be incorrectly enforced due to other quirks in the treatment of HTTP headers. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Analysis in the Wild</head><p>In this section, we report on a large-scale analysis performed in the wild with our policy analyzer. Our analysis shows that many popular Web sites implement inconsistent protection against click-jacking and sheds light on the root causes of this potential security problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data Collection</head><p>To assess inconsistencies at scale, we decided to analyze the top 10,000 sites from the Tranco list of October 29, 2019. As we did not only want to check the start pages in a static manner, we instead used a Chrome-based crawler to visit the start pages, collect all links on them, and follow those links up to at most 500 items per site. (Here, "site" refers to the registrable domain name or eTLD+1.) In doing so, we did not only collect the headers delivered with the pages we visited, but also those of all iframes on the visited pages. This way, we were able to (partially) account for sites where only specific pages are protected against framing-based attacks. We then retrieved the XFO and CSP headers of the collected URLs, sending each request to a URL once for each of the different user-agent strings considered in our study.</p><p>For this step, we primarily relied on Python's Requests library to collect data. However, Requests folds multiple response headers with the same name into a comma-separated list, as specified in RFC 7230 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. As discussed in Section 4.2, browsers do not necessarily follow this specification, but might rather consume each header separately, meaning that Requests' approach to parsing headers would not properly account for that. Therefore, in case we detect a comma in either the XFO or CSP header, we fall back to curl, which outputs the headers line-by-line. To further improve resiliency against possible crawling errors, we filtered out from the dataset all the pages where we observed that at least one user agent was not receiving the XFO or CSP headers, while other user agents were. Though this might lose some inconsistencies, e.g., when CSP headers are not actually sent to legacy browsers, we preferred to be conservative and work on more reliable data rather than risking to unduly exacerbate the number of inconsistencies in the wild. In particular, we found that several pages did not consistently deliver the same XFO and/or CSP headers, even when visited multiple times with the same User-Agent string. Finally, we performed a de-duplication of the collected framing control policies by removing all the duplicate combinations of XFO and CSP policies collected within the same origin, to avoid biasing the dataset construction towards origins with hundreds of pages all using the same policy.</p><p>At the end of the data collection process, we visited 989,875 URLs overall. Of those, 369,606 URLs (37%) across 5,835 sites carried either an XFO or CSP header aimed at framing control. After the dataset cleaning and the de-duplication process explained above, we were left with 17,613 framing control policies. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows the adoption of the different security mechanisms in the different policies. We observe that XFO is still the most widespread defense mechanism against click-jacking in the wild by far, yet around 12% of the collected policies make use of CSP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Inconsistent Policies</head><p>Overall, we identified 1,800 policies from 1,779 origins implementing inconsistent protection against click-jacking, i.e., where the enforced level of protection is dependent on the browser. This is 10% of the analyzed policies, which is already a significant percentage. But this result becomes even more concerning when we take a look at which click-jacking protection mechanisms are used by such policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defense</head><p>Number   <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Defenses used in the inconsistent policies <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> provides the breakdown: the relative majority of the inconsistencies (45%) occur when XFO and CSP are used together, which suggests that having two different mechanisms for the same purpose is potentially dangerous. Moreover, note that 805 out of the 1,484 pages (54%) which make use of both XFO and CSP together implement inconsistent protection against click-jacking, i.e., it is more likely to get the combination of the two defenses wrong than right.</p><p>Another interesting insight from our analysis is that 84% of the inconsistent policies make use of CSP. Intuitively, this seems related to the fact that the set of browsers we consider includes some legacy browsers without CSP support: in particular, Opera Mini provides very limited tools to protect against click-jacking. Hence, one might think that inconsistencies are motivated by its presence alone, yet this is not the case: if we removed Opera Mini from the set of browsers, the number of inconsistent policies would drop from 1,800 to 1,749, which is roughly a 3% reduction. One might then try to also remove Internet Explorer from the picture, since it also lacks support for CSP. However, this is a different story than Opera Mini, since Internet Explorer supports the ALLOW-FROM directive. Hence, inconsistencies could be fixed by simulating the behavior of CSP through different values of ALLOW-FROM based on the Referer header (see Section 2).</p><p>To understand the prevalence of such practice in the wild, we set up the following experiment: for each page in our dataset, we identify the hosts which are allowed framing according to CSP, and we send an HTTP request to the page with the Referer header set to one of such hosts. In the presence of wildcards in CSP, e.g., *.example.com, we generate a synthetic candidate Referer matching them, e.g., https://test.example.com. If we observe that the value of the Referer is reflected back in the XFO header of the response, it means that we might have false positives in our set of inconsistencies, because the originally collected XFO headers only provided a partial picture of the deployed policy. We managed to perform this test on the 2,198 pages with CSP and observed extremely low adoption of Referer sniffing: in particular, only 11 pages relied on such practice. This gives us confidence in the correctness of the conclusions we draw.</p><p>In the next section, we provide an in-depth analysis of the inconsistent policies we collected. We do this while considering the full set of browsers in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, because those browsers are actively used, and we want to assess the state of clickjacking protection on the Web as of now. We elaborate on the impact of the chosen browsers on our study in Section 5.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Analysis of Inconsistent Policies</head><p>To have a more in-depth look into the set of inconsistent policies, we performed a further classification step: in particular, we identified 590 security-oriented policies (33%) and 795 compatibility-oriented policies (44%), while the other 415 inconsistent policies (23%) do not belong to any of these two classes, hence are unduly inconsistent. In the rest of this section, we perform an in-depth analysis of the collected inconsistent policies and identify dangerous practices therein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Security-Oriented Policies</head><p>The existence of security-oriented policies is justified by the fact that XFO is less expressive than CSP, hence Web developers might be led into shipping XFO headers that are more restrictive than the corresponding CSP headers. For example, the Web site https://www.icloud.com deploys an XFO header set to SAMEORIGIN and a CSP whitelisting every subdomain of icloud.com and apple.com. A similar situation happens on https://academia.stackexchange.com, which sets XFO to SAMEORIGIN and uses CSP to whitelist both itself and https://stackexchange.com. These policies offer a good level of protection to legacy browsers, but might introduce compatibility issues therein.</p><p>We further categorized the 590 security-oriented policies in two classes. The first class includes ineffective policies, where CSP is overly liberal compared to XFO: these policies allow framing from any host on CSP-enabled browsers, possibly just restricting its scheme, hence modern browsers are left unprotected. We noticed this problem just in 13 cases (2%), and we conjecture it might come from the wrong assumption that, when both XFO and CSP are enabled, they are both enforced, while CSP actually overrides XFO and voids protection. However, it is positive to see that this class of policies is highly under-represented. The other policies all take advantage of the additional expressive power of CSP over XFO for fine-grained whitelisting: specifically, we observed 99 cases (17%) where CSP was used to whitelist all the subdomains of the host whitelisted via XFO, while in all other cases CSP whitelisted at least two source expressions.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, these look like legitimate use cases, where policy inconsistency is not necessarily dangerous for security. However, this discrepancy raises concerns, because it implies that either legacy browsers suffer from compatibility issues due to overly harsh security enforcement, or modern browsers are excessively liberal in their treatment of framing, i.e., the policies violate principle of least privilege.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Compatibility-Oriented Policies</head><p>Compatibility-oriented policies might be justified by the need to make Web applications accessible by legacy browsers, at the cost of (partially) sacrificing security in that case. For example, the Web site https://www.spotify.com deploys  Recall that our dataset contains 795 compatibility-oriented policies. The first analysis we perform aims at understanding how much security legacy browsers sacrifice for such policies. For the very large majority of compatibility-oriented policies, we observed that XFO does not provide any protection at all, i.e., framing is allowed from any origin: this happened in 758 cases (95%). In particular, we found 705 pages where an XFO header is entirely absent (89%) and 99 pages where the XFO headers contain an incorrect directive or are misinterpreted by some legacy browser (11%). This shows that most Web developers are not actually concerned about offering security to users of legacy browsers, or are just entirely unaware of the existence of this problem.</p><p>To get a better understanding of the reasons underlying the existence of compatibility-oriented policies, we analyze the combination of XFO and CSP for the following scenario: if CSP is used to whitelist at most one origin, it is straightforward to write an XFO header which enforces exactly the same restrictions, hence the adoption of a compatibility-oriented policy is unjustified. We observe that this was the case for 105 policies (13%), where protection could be improved with minimal effort and expertise by the Web developers, i.e., without resorting to Referer sniffing. This shows that the bleak picture given above could be easily improved to some extent, yet this is not happening in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Unduly Inconsistent Policies</head><p>Finally, we focus on the 415 inconsistent policies that are neither security-oriented nor compatibility-oriented. These policies are hard to justify as secure, or even as intended, as explained in Section 3. In particular, we observe the following distribution of (possibly overlapping) classes:</p><p>• 315 policies are interpreted differently by at least two legacy browsers (76%);</p><p>• 289 policies are interpreted differently by at least two modern browsers (69%);</p><p>• 29 policies are given the same interpretation by all legacy browsers and all modern browsers, yet these two interpretations are incomparable (7%).</p><p>What is worse is that 380 of these policies (92%) do not enforce any form of framing restriction on at least one of the browsers considered in our study, which confirms that this class of inconsistencies is particularly dangerous for security. For example, the Web site https://es.sprint.com sets an XFO header to ALLOW-FROM https://www.sprint.com, but does not ship a companion CSP: this leaves browsers without support for ALLOW-FROM unprotected. As another example, https://whois.web.com sends two XFO headers, one set to SAMEORIGIN and one set to DENY, which allows same-origin framing in some browsers but not others.</p><p>It is instructive to have a look at why these undue inconsistencies arise. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> provides the breakdown of the main practices leading to policy inconsistency (classes partially overlap). We observe that the ALLOW-FROM directive is present in most of the unduly inconsistent policies, which shows that XFO is not properly coupled with CSP in those cases. Indeed, 322 out of 465 policies that use ALLOW-FROM do not come with any CSP (69%) and do not offer any protection on most modern browsers. It is also interesting that we found 53 policies where both XFO and CSP are syntactically correct, yet express incomparable policies. For example, we noticed that https://gfp.sd.gov deploys an XFO header set to SAME-ORIGIN, while its CSP allows framing from every subdomain of arcgis.com, soundcloud.com and flipsnack.com. We do not have definite explanations for this kind of policies, but a plausible reason could be that XFO was deployed for a legacy version of the Web site and never updated later.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">Perspective</head><p>We summarize here the security impact of our findings by computing the number of policies that do not offer any level of protection to at least one browser. We also present the same perspective for modern browsers alone. The presence and distribution of vulnerable policies for these two cases are shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. These numbers confirm our claim that not all inconsistencies are necessarily dangerous, yet their majority actually is (64%). In particular, almost every inconsistent policy that is not security-oriented is completely ineffective on  <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Presence and distribution of vulnerable policies at least one browser. Luckily, our experiments also show that users of modern browsers enjoy a significantly higher level of protection than users of legacy browsers since only 16% of the inconsistencies actually void any form of security enforcement in a modern browser, where undue inconsistencies are essentially the only threat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">The Role of Browsers</head><p>Since we assess inconsistencies over a set of popular browsers, one might wonder to which extent the chosen browsers bias the results of our study. To understand this point, we decided to run a second analysis by removing Internet Explorer and Opera Mini from the set of browsers under test. The rationale of this choice is that these browsers do not support CSP, and thus, we might get a picture of how much the current policy deployment would be inconsistent in a world without legacy browsers. It turns out that the total number of inconsistent policies would drop from 1,800 to 289, which is a major improvement. However, observe that all such policies fall in the class of unduly inconsistent policies (since we removed legacy browsers), and we computed that for 278 of them (96%) there is at least one modern browser which does not enforce any form of restriction. This confirms that the adoption of modern browsers strongly mitigates the problem of inconsistencies, yet not entirely solved. The main reasons for inconsistency would still be the use of ALLOW-FROM and the adoption of a comma-separated list of directives in XFO. It is also particularly interesting that two of the browsers that we tested have been undergoing major changes at the time of writing. The first significant change was implemented in Firefox, which dropped support for the ALLOW-FROM directive in version 70. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Moreover, Microsoft announced that Edge will move to the Chromium architecture in 2020, which likely means that it will drop support for ALLOW-FROM and fix the problems with XFO headers. These changes go in the direction of reducing the risk of inconsistencies in modern browsers, which will eventually be uniformed to Chromium derivates. Unfortunately, we also showed that 322 out of 465 policies that use ALLOW-FROM do not come with any CSP (69%), which implies that these changes are weakening the state of click-jacking protection on the Web.</p><p>At the end of the day, we believe that the problem of inconsistencies in click-jacking protection is far from solved. Though legacy browsers not supporting CSP are likely going to disappear in a few years, it is hard to predict a precise temporal horizon for this: for example, Internet Explorer 11 was launched in 2013, and it still has ∼ 2% of the market share based on publicly available data, while Opera Mini is still under active development and extremely popular with around 15% market share in Africa, where mobile traffic is still expensive. 8 Also, it should be noted that the versions of Edge and Firefox considered in the present study might still be around for a while, i.e., the Web platform will still be accessed by browsers supporting ALLOW-FROM at least in the near future. Though a full transition from XFO to CSP for click-jacking protection is the way to go to solve the issue of inconsistencies, the setting is complex and requires actions at different levels. We discuss recommendations and countermeasures in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Limitations</head><p>Though we strived to quantify the security impact of the detected policy inconsistencies, we cannot show that even policies that do not provide any form of framing control in some browsers lead to exploitable vulnerabilities in practice. To overcome this limitation, we would need to identify pages that are susceptible to framing-based attacks. However, identifying these in an automated fashion at a large scale requires accounts of all tested sites as well as an in-depth understanding of the application's semantics. However, we argue that it is fair to assume that site operators are deploying framing control for a reason. In our opinion, the widespread adoption of framing control policies (33% of all crawled URLs, spread across 58% of the sites we looked at) motivates that click-jacking is perceived as an important security threat. Our analysis acts as a cautionary tale aimed at raising awareness of the potential issues that arise from policy inconsistencies.</p><p>In addition to this, we also remark that our study specifically focuses on the 10,000 most popular sites at the time of writing the paper. Given the diversity of the Web in general, this does not necessarily enable us to generalize about framing control inconsistencies on the entire Web. As prior work has shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, though, the popularity of domains often represents a proxy for security measures, meaning that our results most likely are a lower bound of the actual problems discoverable in the wild.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Recommendations and Countermeasures</head><p>Based on the data gathered in our analysis of both browser implementations and real-world deployment of framing control, we discuss lessons learned to improve the situation. In particular, we first present recommendations for both Web developers and browser vendors, highlighting some room for improvement which we found. We then discuss our implementation of a server-side proxy capable of retrofitting framing control policies in existing Web applications for the diverse set of browsers we considered in our analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Recommendations for Web Developers</head><p>The first important recommendation we make is that both XFO and CSP must be used for effective framing control on the current Web. XFO alone is insufficient for security because sites might be prone to double framing attacks (also in modern browsers like UC Browser) or even not protected at all (most notably, in the presence of the largely unsupported ALLOW-FROM directive). On the other hand, just using CSP results in leaving users of legacy browsers completely unprotected. Unfortunately, we found that only 8% of the collected policies use both XFO and CSP. Worse, the combination of the two mechanisms proved hard to get right for Web developers, as 54% of such policies are inconsistent.</p><p>The other crucial recommendations are about the use of XFO. Web developers should ensure that at most one XFO header is sent with every Web page because existing browsers have inconsistent interpretations in the presence of multiple XFO headers. What is worth noting here is that there is no good practical reason to deploy more than one XFO header. In the presence of multiple XFO headers, existing browsers either enforce the first one (thus voiding the others) or simultaneously enforce all of them. However, even this is useless, because any pair of XFO directives always contains either redundant or contradictory information, which can be expressed with a single XFO directive (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 8</ref>). For the same reasons we just discussed, Web developers should avoid the use of comma-separated values in XFO headers. These headers are parsed as multiple XFO headers in most browsers, while in other browsers, they are interpreted as non-existing directives that do not enforce any form of framing control. This latter observation shows that even the apparently innocuous practice of repeating the same directive multiple times is actually insecure because it voids protection on some browsers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Recommendations for Browser Vendors</head><p>Though the frame-ancestors directive obsoleted XFO back in 2014, XFO is still very popular in the wild: 88% of the policies we collected are still based on XFO alone. This means that this is not the right time to drop support for XFO, and one might wonder if this will ever be possible without leaving a significant fraction of the Web unprotected. An important point we would like to stress is the need for more informational messages for Web developers, e.g., in the JavaScript console. A prime example of this issue comes from the recent removal of support for ALLOW-FROM in Firefox. When visiting a page that sends an XFO header containing such a directive, Firefox merely notes an invalid header and points the developer to the generic Mozilla Developer Network page on XFO. This page does note that ALLOW-FROM is now obsolete and should not be used, but does not provide an immediately visible and explicit warning that sites using ALLOW-FROM have suddenly become unprotected. As to Chrome, the JavaScript console only shows a warning about an unrecognized directive and nothing more.</p><p>We argue that browsers should explicitly warn Web developers about the possibility of using CSP to achieve the same effect of XFO, which is straightforward considered that CSP is more expressive than XFO. In particular, XFO policies which do not contain glaring mistakes can be readily transformed into corresponding CSPs. We designed one such solution as part of our server-side proxy (see Section 6.3), which might be inspiring also for browser vendors since the same approach could be applied at the client. We understand that major browser vendors might consider such transformations dangerous for backward compatibility, yet even simple transformations might significantly increase security in the wild and are worth testing in our opinion. At the very least, a candidate value for frame-ancestors combined with a clear warning about the unprotected state of the site should be reported in the JavaScript console.</p><p>On more general terms, we think that our paper shows the importance of implementing only client-side security mechanisms that come with a clear and precise specification. The XFO specification was put together only after major browsers already implemented support for the XFO header, which led to many different implementations. Though the auto-update feature of modern browsers certainly helps in mitigating the problem of inconsistencies, real-world market share data show that legacy browsers are hard to eradicate. Once a client-side security mechanism has been inconsistently implemented across browsers, it might be challenging to understand its long-lasting impact in the wild. For example, without moving away from CSP, the strict-dynamic source expression has first been implemented in Chrome due to an independent effort from Google's engineers and then pushed into the CSP standard. This kind of practice is dangerous because other browser vendors might be unwilling to pick up: for example,  Safari still lacks support for strict-dynamic. This decision, however, may well be a good one, given that recent work has shown the dangers of strict-dynamic through script gadgets, and even Google engineers now advocate to instead rely on explicit passing of nonces <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Nevertheless, this feature is inconsistently implemented across browsers already and unlikely to be removed in the near future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Retrofitting Security</head><p>As Web developers might not be aware of the intricacies of the two mechanisms available to control the framing of their sites, we developed a server-side proxy designed to enforce consistency in framing control policies, i.e., to ensure all browsers enforce the same level of protection. The proxy is a Python script (∼ 800 LoC), which can be run at the server. It inspects the HTTP traffic to automatically fix the framing control headers so as to ensure policy consistency. To enable researchers to build on our work and website administrators to benefit from the tool, we have made the proxy available at https://github.com/cispa/framing-control-proxy.</p><p>In particular, for any request r, let r stand for the corresponding HTTP response. If r contains XFO headers, but no CSP header with a frame-ancestors directive, the proxy behaves as follows:</p><p>1. if multiple XFO headers are present in r, they are first folded into one XFO header set to a comma-separated list of the specified directives;</p><p>2. after step 1, r is guaranteed to contain exactly one XFO header. If the header contains a comma-separated list of directives, it is replaced by a single directive enforcing the same security restrictions of the conjunction of the directives. This is always possible, thanks to the simplification rules in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 8;</ref> 3. the proxy finally attaches to r a new CSP header enforcing the same framing control restrictions of the sanitized XFO header. This is straightforward, since CSP is more expressive than XFO, and does not conflict with other CSP headers possibly present in r, since, when multiple CSP headers are sent, their conjunction is enforced and no other frame-ancestors directive is present.</p><p>If r contains CSP headers with a frame-ancestors directive, the proxy instead behaves as follows:</p><p>1. all the XFO headers of r are stripped away;</p><p>2. the proxy computes the union of the source expressions whitelisted in all the frame-ancestors directives contained in the CSP headers of r;</p><p>3. if CSP denies framing, r is extended with an XFO header containing the DENY directive. If instead CSP only allows same-origin framing, r is extended with an XFO header containing the SAMEORIGIN directive. Otherwise, the proxy checks if the Referer header of r contains a URL whitelisted by any of the source expressions identified at step 2: if this is the case, r is extended with an XFO header containing an ALLOW-FROM directive set to the origin of the Referer header; otherwise, the XFO header is set to DENY. If r lacks the Referer header, the proxy conservatively sets the XFO header to DENY.</p><p>Eventually, the proxy ensures the consistency of framing control policies with respect to the set of tested browsers, by equating the security guarantees of XFO and CSP (up to double framing). Observe that, although Opera Mini supports neither CSP nor ALLOW-FROM, the proxy still manages to rectify its limitations. In particular, if the Referer of the request is set to a whitelisted URL, the proxy sets XFO to the corresponding ALLOW-FROM directive, which is just ignored by Opera Mini and framing is allowed. Otherwise, the proxy sets XFO to DENY, and the page cannot be framed.</p><p>In our design, we prioritize CSP headers over XFO headers when both are present since CSP is the preferred method to enforce framing control in modern browsers. This means that it is occasionally possible for the proxy to relax security restrictions beyond least privilege: for example, if a page sets XFO to DENY and CSP allows same-origin framing, then XFO will be relaxed to SAMEORIGIN. However, this is sensible from a security perspective, because modern browsers already allow same-origin framing, so we assume this was intended by the site administrators, as modern browsers are the primary target in the market and are also easier to test. This is also backed up by our dataset, where we observed only 13 policies where XFO was tighter than CSP and CSP was configured in an obviously insecure manner (see <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>).</p><p>As a final point, we note that the Referer header may be stripped when controlled through the Referrer-Policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, which would disable the possibility of performing Referer sniffing in the proxy. However, Referrer-Policy is only supported in browsers that also support the frame-ancestors directive of CSP. Since the proxy only relies on Referer sniffing in the presence of frame-ancestors, the DENY directive placed in the absence of the Referer header would be overridden by CSP in all cases. After implementing our proxy, we tested it out against the full set of test cases of Section 4.2. By doing so, we confirmed that the proxy behaves as expected and enforces the same security restrictions in the entire pool of browsers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>In this section, we present related work, and for the work closest to ours, we explain the main differences.</p><p>CSP and XFO for Framing Control In their 2019 paper, Luo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> studied the evolution of mobile browsers and their support for client-side security mechanisms over time. In doing so, they also documented the interplay between CSP and XFO, reporting in particular that some mobile browsers did not prioritize CSP over XFO in the past. Their paper generically hints that inconsistencies between CSP and XFO could occur based on the collected headers, yet the paper does not go much in detail about this. The increased importance of CSP for framing control was also documented by Roth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, who analyzed the evolution of CSP from 2012 to 2018, indicating that CSP has become more and more popular as a protection mechanism against click-jacking. They also evaluated the dangers coming from the inconsistent support for ALLOW-FROM and CSP in different browsers, most notably by leveraging the well-known observation that the ALLOW-FROM directive is not supported in Chrome.</p><p>Though both these studies have been inspiring starting points for our work, we extend the mere analysis of the potential problems by building a comprehensive framework to reason about inconsistencies. In particular: (i) we formally define the problem of inconsistencies in framing control policies to provide a full account of this security problem, highlighting different classes of inconsistencies with different security implications; (ii) we focus on both desktop browsers and mobile browsers, exposing many new and unreported dangerous implementations of the underspecified XFO header; (iii) we perform an in-depth analysis of several root causes of inconsistencies in the wild, their security import, and some possible countermeasures, discussing the potential role of browser vendors on the way forward; and (iv) we implement and release a server-side proxy designed to retrofit security in existing Web applications by enforcing consistency for the set of browsers that we analyzed.</p><p>Click-Jacking Protection and Attacks In 2010, Rydstedt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> studied the usage of frame busting scripts in the Alexa Top 500 sites, showing that the deployed mechanisms through JavaScript were trivial to bypass. In the same year, <ref type="bibr">Balduzzi et al.</ref> [2] built a system capable of detecting clickjacking, primarily based on the assumption that elements should not be overlapping when clicked. In 2012, Lekies et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> highlighted additional techniques for bypassing existing defenses and showed the shortcomings of XFO for fine-grained framing control. In the same year, Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> conducted an in-depth analysis of the underlying issues and proposed INCONTEXT, in which applications could mark specific elements as sensitive (e.g., Like buttons), which would, through various defensive techniques, be protected from forced clicks at the browser. In 2014, Akhawe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> generalized click-jacking to perceptual UI attacks and showed how easily users could be tricked into clicking unwanted elements while seemingly playing a benign game.</p><p>Inconsistencies in Web Security Inconsistencies in the implementation of client-side security mechanisms have been first studied by Singh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Their seminal work focused on access control policies and, in particular, on parts of the Same Origin Policy (SOP), which proved to be inconsistently implemented in existing Web browsers at the time. A similar study was later performed on modern browsers by <ref type="bibr">Schwenk et al.</ref>, and also exposed dangerous inconsistencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Automated testing has been proposed as an effective technique to catch bugs in the implementation of client-side security mechanisms by Hothersall-Thomas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. None of these studies focused on inconsistencies in framing control policies.</p><p>Naturally, the client is not the only software where inconsistencies may occur. In particular, prior work has investigated the handling of multiple Host headers in CDNs and origin servers, showing that due to differences in handling multiple headers, these two components end up with a different understanding of the requested host <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In a recent paper, Nguyen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> showed that inconsistencies in allowed header lengths or control characters could allow an attacker to force origin servers to yield error pages. This, in combination with CDNs that cache such error pages, can lead to a cachepoisoned Denial of Service attack. In non-academic research, Kettle <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> showed that using multiple Content-Length headers as well as conflicting Transfer-Encoding allows for HTTP Desync attacks. Albeit only indirectly related to our paper, these works clearly document the dangers of inconsistent implementations on the Web. Finally, Mendoza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> studied the inconsistent adoption of security mechanisms in the mobile and the desktop version of the same Web site. They even showed attacks where the insecurity of a mobile site could be exploited to target the desktop site, which sits at a higher security level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented the first comprehensive analysis of inconsistencies in framing control policies. We based our investigation on a formal framework, which constituted the basis for the implementation of a real-world policy analyzer dubbed FRAMECHECK. Our analysis of 10,000 Web sites from the Tranco list showed that the problem of inconsistencies is widespread on the Web, since around 10% of the (distinct) framing control policies in the wild are inconsistent and most often do not provide any form of protection to at least one browser. Given the insights of the dangers caused through inconsistencies, we proposed different countermeasures in terms of recommendations for Web developers and browser vendors, as well as the implementation of a server-side proxy designed to retrofit security to existing Web applications. We are currently in the process of responsibly disclosing the security issues found throughout our comprehensive analysis to the affected browser vendors and site operators.</p><p>We foresee a few avenues for future work. First, we would like to extend our current analysis to uncover inconsistencies between the desktop version and the mobile version of the same Web site, following the approach proposed by Mendoza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Then, we plan to generalize our formal framework to other client-side security mechanisms besides XFO and the framing control fragment of CSP. Finally, we would like to carry out a systematic analysis of the compatibility impact of some of our proposed countermeasures, which we only evaluated in terms of security so far. This might require close collaboration with browser vendors to understand their impact on a large scale.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Schemes s ::= http | https Host Expressions h ::= * | *.string | string Source Expressions e ::= 'self' | s | h | (s, h) Directive Values v ::= {e 1 , . . . , e n }</figDesc></figure>
