				<p>This paper presents a new End-to-End (E2E) verifiable e-voting protocol for large-scale elections, called Direct Recording Electronic with Integrity (DRE-i). In contrast to all other E2E verifiable voting schemes, ours does not involve any Tallying Authorities (TAs). The design of DRE-i is based on the hypothesis that existing E2E voting protocols&apos; universal dependence on TAs is a key obstacle to their practical deployment. In DRE-i, the need for TAs is removed by applying novel encryption techniques such that after the election multiplying the ciphertexts together will cancel out random factors and permit anyone to verify the tally. We describe how to apply the DRE-i protocol to enforce the tallying integrity of a DRE-based election held at a set of supervised polling stations. Each DRE machine directly records votes just as the existing practice in the real-world DRE deployment. But unlike the ordinary DRE machines, in DRE-i the machine must publish additional audit data to allow public verification of the tally. If the machine attempts to cheat by altering either votes or audit data, then the public verification of the tallying integrity will fail. To improve system reliability, we further present a fail-safe mechanism to allow graceful recovery from the effect of missing or corrupted ballots in a publicly verifiable and privacy-preserving manner. Finally, we compare DRE-i with previous related voting schemes and show several improvements in security, efficiency and usability. This highlights the promising potential of a new category of voting systems that are E2E verifiable and TA-free. We call this new category &quot;self-enforcing electronic voting&quot;.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Background. An electronic voting (e-voting) system is a voting system in which the election data is recorded, stored and processed primarily as digital information <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[VoteHere 2002]</ref>. Depending on the implementation, e-voting can be either local or remote. Local e-voting occurs at a supervised polling station, normally using a touch-screen machine to record votes directly. Such a machine is often called a Direct Recording Electronic (or DRE) machine <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Kohno et al. 2004]</ref>. In contrast, remote e-voting can be conducted at any location, usually through a web browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Adida 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida et al. 2009]</ref>.</p><p>E-voting has already been widely deployed across the world. As shown in USA Today <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[Wolf 2008]</ref>, the use of DRE expanded rapidly in the United States following the 2000 national election: from 12% of the votes cast in that election to <ref type="bibr">29% in 2004, and to 38% in 2006</ref>. India moved to full DRE voting in their 2004 national election, and Brazil started its first fully DRE-based election in 2002 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Blanc 2007]</ref>. In 2007, Estonia became the first country to allow Internet voting for national elections <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Krimmer et al. 2007]</ref>. Many other countries have been actively pursuing the implementation of e-voting [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alvarez et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Pieters 2011]</ref>.</p><p>Controversy. However, e-voting has become controversial. In 2004, Kohno et al. critically analysed a type of e-voting machine that had been widely used in the US, and discovered serious software vulnerabilities and bugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Kohno et al. 2004]</ref>. The alarming level of security flaws was especially worrying because the U.S. government had earlier certified the machine to be "trustworthy". In response to these and other similar findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[Sherman et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jefferson et al. 2004</ref>] regarding other manufacturers' machines, many people have demanded that e-voting be abandoned completely. Several U.S. states consequently abandoned the use of e-voting machines in 2008, causing a rapid decline of DRE usage from 38% in 2006 to 32% in 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[Wolf 2008</ref>]. Similar problems have also been reported in other countries, e.g., Germany, Netherlands and Ireland have all susThis work is supported by the European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant (No. 106591) on "Self-enforcing electronic voting: trustworthy elections in the presence of corrupt authorities".  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. Self-enforcing e-voting with E2E verifiability homomorphic tallying <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009]</ref>. In 2009, a customized variant of Helios 2.0 was adopted by the Universit√© catholique de Louvain (UCL) in a campus election to elect the university president.</p><p>As highlighted in the Helios paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009]</ref>, the practical implementation of tallying authorities has proved to be "a particularly difficult issue". To ensure the fairness in the representations, the tallying authorities were chosen from various groups (students, administrative staff and so on) with different backgrounds (not just computer science). However, it turned out that the chosen authorities did not have the required technical expertise to perform complex cryptographic operations. Hence, a group of "external experts" (whose identities are not mentioned in the Helios paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009]</ref>) were invited to first perform the key generation on behalf of the tallying authorities. The whole procedure included purchasing brand new laptops, removing the hard disk drives, disabling wireless network cards, booting up the machines using standard linux live-CDs and loading the key generation code (written in Python) through the USB sticks. Subsequently, the tallying authorities' private keys were generated and stored on the USB sticks, which were then distributed to the authorities. In the mean time, all of the generated private keys were centrally backed up by one trusted third party (a notary public). After the election, "a similar procedure was followed when those keys were used for decryption" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009]</ref>. Clearly, the tallying authorities' further dependence on "external experts" and a single trusted third party for backup has significantly complicated the trust relationships in the election management.</p><p>Removing TAs. A few researchers have investigated how to remove tallying authorities in electronic voting. Kiayias and Yung first studied this in 2002 with a boardroom voting protocol [Kiayias and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Yung 2002]</ref>, followed by Groth in 2004 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Groth 2004</ref>] and Hao-Ryan-Zieli¬¥nskiZieli¬¥nski in 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Hao et al. 2010]</ref>. Among these boardroom voting protocols, the Hao-Ryan-Zieli¬¥nskiZieli¬¥nski's solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Hao et al. 2010]</ref> is so far the most efficient in every aspect: the number of rounds, the computation load and the message size. In general, a boardroom voting protocol works by requiring voters to cooperatively interact with all other voters in a network in a number of rounds. In the best case <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Hao et al. 2010]</ref>, only two rounds of interactions are needed. The tallying result is usually computed by voters through exhaustive search. Essentially, the voting is totally decentralized and run by the voters themselves. A decentralized boardroom voting protocol, such as Kiayias-Yung's [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kiayias and Yung 2002]</ref>, Groth's <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Groth 2004</ref>], or Hao-Ryan-Zieli¬¥nskiZieli¬¥nski's <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Hao et al. 2010]</ref>, can provide the theoretically-best protection of ballot secrecy. In order to learn a voter's secret choice, the attacker must compromise all other voters to form a full collusion against the voter <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Kiayias and Yung 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Groth 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hao et al. 2010]</ref>.</p><p>A boardroom voting protocol is considered different from an E2E verifiable voting protocol for a number of reasons. First of all, they differ on the scales. The former is usually designed for small-scale voting in a boardroom, while the latter is normally for large-scale country voting. Using exhaustive search to determine the tally may be straightforward in boardroom voting, but it may prove expensive if the election is a large-scale one (especially for multi-candidate elections). Second, the system infrastructures are different. The former is decentralized; voters use their own trusted computing hardware/software to interact with all other voters through a fully connected network. There is no voter-receipt (as there is no entity to issue receipts) and there is no central bulletin board to check receipts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Hao et al. 2010]</ref>. The latter is centralized; there is little interaction between voters. People vote through some common voting interface (e.g., touch-screen DRE). A voter normally gets a receipt, which can be compared against a central bulletin board. Third, the security requirements are completely different. For example, in a boardroom voting protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Kiayias and Yung 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Groth 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hao et al. 2010]</ref>, a voter can trivially prove to a coercer how she had voted by revealing the ephemeral secret generated during the protocol. Furthermore, any arbitrary voter can easily disrupt a multi-round voting procedure by simply dropping out half-way in the protocol. While coercion, vote selling and voter disruption might not be considered serious issues in a small boardroom, they are important considerations in the design of an E2E verifiable voting system.</p><p>The scope of this paper is to focus on E2E verifiable voting systems for large-scale elections. Existing boardroom voting protocols are clearly unsuitable for any country-scale elections. However, they are still relevant to our study as they demonstrate that it is possible to remove TAs albeit only in the setting of a small-scale election. To the best of our knowledge, no one has investigated the feasibility of removing tallying authorities for large-scale elections. Indeed, existing E2E verifiable e-voting protocols designed for large-scale elections universally require involving external tallying authorities in the tallying process <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Kiayias et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clarkson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adida 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaum et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaum et al. 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Ryan et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adida and Neff 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaum 2004]</ref>.</p><p>Contributions. We initiate a study on whether it is feasible to remove the dependence on external tallying authorities in an E2E verifiable voting system. Along this direction, we propose to replace the tallying authorities and the decryption system in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> by a public algorithm. We define the resultant system as a "self-enforcing e-voting" system (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Because the algorithm is public, the tallying process is fully verifiable without any TA involvement. The main contributions of this paper are summarized below: -We present the first E2E verifiable voting protocol that is TA-free. Our protocol is called Direct</p><p>Recording Electronic with Integrity (DRE-i). Its "self-enforcing" property is realized by integrating a cancellation formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Hao and Zieli¬¥nskiZieli¬¥nski 2006]</ref> into the homomorphic tallying process: the encryption of votes follows a well-defined structure such that after the election multiplying the ciphertexts together will cancel out random factors and permit anyone to verify the tally. A similar tallying method was used in a previous Hao-Ryan-Zieli¬¥nskiZieli¬¥nski boardroom voting protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Hao et al. 2010]</ref>, but ours does not require exhaustive search. Although the two protocols share the same mathematical formula for cancelling random factors, they are designed for completely different election scenarios and have different security requirements. -We effectively combine the basic DRE-i with several additional engineering designs to make it an overall secure and practical system, suitable for a DRE-based election at polling stations. The first is to seamlessly integrate the voter's initiated auditing into the natural confirm/cancel voting experience on a touch-screen DRE. As a result, the system is user-friendly to a voter who does not understand cryptography at all. Furthermore, we provide a fail-safe mechanism to allow graceful recovery of partially corrupted audit data in a publicly verifiable and privacy-preserving way. Finally, we support a distributed computation of secret keys to distribute trust and improve system availability. (Advantages of our system over previous ones will be detailed in Section 4.)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">A SELF-ENFORCING E-VOTING PROTOCOL</head><p>In this section, we describe a self-enforcing e-voting protocol called Direct Recording Electronic with Integrity (DRE-i). In particular, we show how to apply the DRE-i protocol to enforce the tallying integrity of DRE-based local voting at the polling station. (It is possible to implement DRE-i for remote voting <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Hao et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hao et al. 2013</ref>], but to avoid confusion, we will focus on local voting in this paper.) For the simplicity of discussion, we will consider a single-candidate election first, and then extend it to multiple candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">User roles</head><p>In an E2E verifiable e-voting protocol, there are generally three user roles as defined below <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009]</ref>.</p><p>(1) Ordinary voter: Someone who directly participates in the voting.</p><p>(2) Auditor: Someone who audits the system by performing real-time checks on the system during the voting process. (3) Universal verifier: Anyone in the world who has the technical expertise to verify the audit data published by the voting system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Integrity requirements</head><p>We also adopt the commonly accepted integrity requirements for an E2E verifiable voting protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaum et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaum et al. 2008a]</ref>.</p><p>(1) Ballot format integrity: Everyone, including third party observers, should be able to verify that every encrypted ballot has the correct format to represent exactly one vote. (2) Ballot casting integrity: All voters should be able to convince themselves that their cast ballots are recorded to the correct candidates. (3) Ballot transmission integrity: All voters should be able to verify that their recorded ballots have been correctly transmitted to the tallying process. (4) Ballot tallying integrity: Everyone, include third party observers, should be able to verify that the tallying result is correctly obtained from the recorded ballots.</p><p>Obviously, the integrity requirements must be satisfied without compromising the voter's privacy. In particular, the receipt that permits a voter to verify the integrity of the voting system must not reveal how she had voted. We will explain in Section 3 that this holds true in DRE-i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Trust assumptions</head><p>There are many other requirements to make a secure e-voting system. Since the satisfaction of those requirements is generally assumed in the literature [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kiayias et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clarkson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adida 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaum et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaum et al. 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adida and Neff 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaum 2004]</ref>, we make the same assumptions, namely:</p><p>(1) User enrolment: Only eligible users can be enrolled in the voter registration. (2) User authentication: Only authenticated voters are allowed to vote during the election. (3) One-man-one-vote: Each authenticated voter is allowed to vote just once. (4) Voting privacy: Voting happens in a private space that no one else can observe. (5) Anonymity: The voting machine that is used does not know the real identity of the voter. (6) Public bulletin board: There is a publicly readable, append-only bulletin board (e.g., a mirrored public website), on which the legitimate voting system can publish audit data for verification (the authenticity of data can be ensured by the use of digital signatures).</p><p>If voting takes place in a supervised environment (say a polling station), it is relatively easy to meet the above assumptions. For example, the polling station staff can authenticate voters based on their ID documents or even biometrics. After successful authentication, the voter is free to take a single random authentication token, say a smart card. The voter then enters a private booth and uses the token to authenticate herself to the machine and starts voting [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kohno et al. 2004]</ref>. To ensure one-person-one-vote, the polling station can publish a list of the names of the people who voted, so that anyone can verify that the number of voters matches the number of cast votes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Chaum et al. 2008a</ref>]. Observers at a polling station can also independently count how many people have actually voted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Three Stages of Voting</head><p>The DRE-i protocol consists of three phases: setup, voting and tallying. The following sections explain each phase in detail.</p><p>2.4.1. Setup phase. We describe the protocol in a multiplicative cyclic group setting (i.e., DSAlike group), though the same protocol also works in an additive cyclic group (i.e., ECDSA-like group). Let p and q be two large primes, where q | p ‚àí 1. Z * p is a multiplicative cyclic group and Note: Data in the first three columns are published on a public bulletin board before the election. They serve as commitment so that the values cannot be later changed. Data in the last two columns are kept secret; they are either computed on-demand during voting or pre-computed before the election.</p><p>G q its subgroup of prime order q. Let g be the generator of G q (any non-identity element in G q can serve as a generator). We assume the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Stinson 2006</ref>] in G q is intractable. The parameters (p, q, g) are publicly agreed before the election starts. Unless the contrary is stated explicitly, all the modular operations are performed with respect to the modulus p. Hence, we omit the explicit " mod p" for simplicity. First of all, the DRE machine generates a private signing key, say using DSA or ECDSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[Stinson 2006</ref>], and publishes the public key on the bulletin board. A tamper-resistant module is used to securely manage the private signing key, in line with industry standard practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Anderson 2008]</ref>. The private signing key is generated on-board in the secure memory of the module and never leaves the protected boundary of the module.</p><p>Subsequently, the DRE machine computes a table as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref>. The table contains n rows with each row corresponding to a ballot, so there are n ballots in total. The number n is the product of the total number of the eligible voters and a safety factor (&gt; 1). The safety factor, say 10, is defined so as to allow the generation of extra ballots for auditing purposes (as we will explain later).</p><p>Each row in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref> corresponds to a ballot with encrypted data (cryptograms) to represent candidate choices. In a single-candidate election, the choices are "Yes" and "No". All rows are constructed to satisfy four properties. First, given any cryptogram in any row, one can easily verify that it is an encryption of one of the two values: "Yes" or "No" (which translate to 1 and 0 in the implementation). Second, given only a single cryptogram from any selected row, one cannot tell whether it is "Yes" or "No". Third, given both cryptograms (unordered) from any selected row, anyone will be able to easily tell which is "Yes" and which is "No". Fourth, given a set of cryptograms, each of which was arbitrarily selected, one from each row, one can easily check how many "Yes" values in total are in the set. In the following, we will explain how these four properties are fulfilled and how they are useful in building a self-enforcing e-voting system.</p><p>The system fills the table as follows. For each of the n ballots, the system computes a random public key g x i , where x i ‚àà R <ref type="bibr">[1, q ‚àí 1]</ref>. When this has been done for all the ballots, the system computes g y i = ‚àè j&lt;i g x j / ‚àè j&gt;i g x j for every ballot. Here, we call the obtained g y i a restructured public key, because it is constructed by multiplying all the random public keys before i and dividing the result by all the public keys after i. Note that anyone is able to compute g y i based on the published g x i values.</p><p>The "Yes"/"No" value in each ballot is encoded in the form of C i = g x i y i ¬∑g v i where v i = 0 for "No" and 1 for "Yes". The no-vote, g x i y i , is indistinguishable from random based on the DDH assumption (detailed proofs can be found in Section 3). Clearly, the yes-vote, g x i y i ¬∑ g, is indistinguishable from random too. However, if both no-vote and yes-vote are published, then it is trivial to distinguish which is "No" and which is "Yes" (because the latter is the former multiplied by g).</p><p>In addition, the system needs to compute a 1-out-of-2 Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for each yes/no value. This is to ensure that the value of the vote is indeed in the correct form of C i = g x i y i ¬∑ g v i where v i ‚àà {0, 1}. In other words, the value v i can only be one of: 0 and 1. We adopt the standard 1-out-of-n ZKP technique (also known as the CDS protocol) due to Cramer, Damg√•rd and Schoenmakers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Cramer et al. 1994]</ref>. Although the original CDS protocol is designed for ElGamal encryption, it is directly applicable here if we regard g y i as a public key. (The only difference is that the public key in ElGamal encryption is statically fixed, while in our case, it is dynamically constructed from g x i values for each ballot.) Here, we use n = 2. The original three-move interactive CDS protocol can be made non-interactive by applying the standard Fiat-Shamir heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Fiat and Shamir 1987]</ref>. The same CDS technique has been widely used in previous e-voting protocols to ensure the published ciphertext is well-formed.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref>, the cryptogram of the no-vote contains g x i y i and a 1-out-of-2 ZKP; similarly, the cryptogram of the yes-vote comprises g x i y i ¬∑ g and a corresponding 1-out-of-2 ZKP.</p><p>Similar to the private signing key, all x i secrets are generated on-board in the module and are stored within the module's secure memory. The corresponding public keys (g x i ) are published on the bulletin board before the election; they serve as commitment so the values cannot be changed later. To ensure authenticity, all commitment data published on the bulletin board should be digitally signed. Let us assume n = 10 5 and a group setting of 2048-bit p and 256-bit q. The total size of x i secrets is 3.2 MB. Hence, it is possible to store the x i secrets entirely in the module's memory. (As an example, a high capacity smart card can have 16 MB non-volatile memory.)</p><p>In order to optimize the performance in voting, one may choose to pre-compute all the cryptograms (last two columns in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref>) before the election. In that case, the secrecy of pre-computed cryptograms needs to be protected at the same level as the x i secrets. If the size of the cryptograms is more than what the module's memory can accommodate, one solution, as commonly adopted in industry, is to generate a master key on-board in the module and use the master key to encrypt blobs of data in an authentic manner, so that the encrypted blobs can be stored outside the module and be reloaded back to memory when needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Anderson 2008]</ref>. This is a typical trade-off between memory and speed. Reloading the blob to memory will involve some decryption work, but since it is only a symmetric-key operation, it can be very fast.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Voting phase.</head><p>As stated before, we assume the eligible voter has been properly authenticated. She first obtains a random authentication token, enters a private voting booth, uses the token to authenticate herself to the machine and starts voting. The voter is prompted to select a choice on a touch screen DRE (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>). To cast her ballot, the voter follows two basic steps below.</p><p>In step one, the voter selects a choice on the screen. Meanwhile, the machine prints the following data on the paper: the ballot serial number i, and the cryptogram of the selected choice. (The ballot serial number i may be incremental or randomly assigned; there is no significant difference from the protocol's perspective as long as the number is unique.) The printed data serve as a commitment, as it cannot be changed. The commitment transcript is digitally signed by the machine to prove its authenticity. As explained earlier, the machine's public key is publicly announced before the election, so the signature is universally verifiable. In step two, the voter has the option of either confirming or cancelling the previous selection. If she chooses to confirm, the system will print a "finish" message on the paper, and a valid encrypted vote has been cast. On the other hand, if she chooses to cancel, the DRE machine will reveal the selected choice in plain text ("Yes" or "No"), and also print the other cryptogram on the paper. In this case, a dummy vote has been cast. The touch screen will return to the previous step and provide another unused ballot. Voters are entitled to cast as many dummy votes as they wish 1 , but are allowed to cast only a single valid vote.</p><p>The confirm/cancel option in step two serves to provide ballot casting assurance, namely: the voter needs to gain confidence that her actual vote has been recorded as she intended. For example, a corrupted machine might cheat by swapping the "No"/"Yes" cryptograms. The solution here is to have the machine initially commit to a value, and then give the voter an option to challenge the machine to reveal the commitment so that if the machine has cheated, it will be caught once the voter chooses to audit. Successful cheating on any large scale without being detected is extremely unlikely. Our auditing procedure is consistent, in spirit, with Benaloh's idea of voter-initiated challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Benaloh 2007]</ref>, but it has been more tightly integrated into the overall cryptographic system starting with the initial setup.</p><p>The commitment transcript, signed by the machine, for the entire voting session can be printed on a single piece of paper, which forms the voter's receipt. The data on the receipt is also available on the public bulletin board. The voter is free to take home the receipt and compare it against the bulletin board, so gaining a degree of trust in the bulletin board's contents. (This is just as in other verifiable e-voting protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Kiayias et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clarkson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adida 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaum et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaum et al. 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adida and Neff 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaum 2004]</ref>). When all the voters have cast their votes, or the election time limit is up, the system will publish both the yes-vote and no-vote cryptograms for the remaining unused ballots and mark them as "dummy" votes.</p><p>2.4.3. Tallying phase. Tallying the ballots involves multiplying together all the published cryptograms V i (for dummy votes, using only the no-vote; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table II</ref>). Thus, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">‚àè i V i = ‚àè i g x i y i g v i = ‚àè i g v i = g ‚àë i v i</formula><p>The key to the tallying process is the fact that ‚àë x i y i = 0 (a cancellation formula first introduced in 2006 in the design of an anonymous veto protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Hao and Zieli¬¥nskiZieli¬¥nski 2006]</ref>; we refer the reader to that paper for the proof). Thus, all random factors cancel each other out. Here, we combine this cancelation technique with the conventional homomorphic encryption to build a self-enforcing e-voting protocol. Compared with the existing mix-net or homomorphic aggregation based tallying methods, the new method has the distinctive feature of not requiring any secret keys (hence no TAs).</p><p>The term ‚àë i v i is the total number of the "yes" votes. Note that we do not need to compute the exponent of g ‚àë i v i (although this is doable by exhaustive search). Because the DRE system records the ballots directly, it announces the count of "yes" votes, Œ≤, right after the election, as is current practice in DRE-based elections. Anyone can verify whether g Œ≤ and g ‚àë i v i are equal. This takes only one exponentiation. Also, anyone can count the number of dummy votes from the bulletin board, which we denote as Œª. Thus, the tally of "no" votes is Œ± = n ‚àí Œ≤ ‚àí Œª.</p><p>There are several ways to extend a single-candidate election to multiple candidates. One straightforward method is to have a Yes/No selection for each of the candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Hao et al. 2010]</ref>. Another method involves defining more efficient encoding values for candidates <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Cramer et al. 1996]</ref>. These are standard techniques to extend a single-candidate election to a multiple-candidate election, while the underlying voting protocol remains unchanged.</p></div>

DDH guarantees that the first and second tuples are indistinguishable. The second and third tuples have the exact same distribution and hence are indistinguishable. DDH also guarantees that the third and fourth tuples are indistinguishable. Hence, the first and fourth tuples, i.e. (g, g a , g b , g ab ) and (g, g a , g b , g ab+1 ) are indistinguishable. In the following analysis, we will first consider a bare bulletin board for simplicity, assuming the underlying ZKPs and digital signature schemes are secure primitives. The ZKPs serve to prove that the ciphertexts published on the bulletin board are well-formed, and they do not reveal any information about the plaintext votes.

Consider two DRE-i elections in which all the votes are exactly the same except for two votes v i and v j which are swapped between the two elections.

If the adversary is one of the voters, he is able to define his own vote.

If A is able to distinguish which of the above two cases the given bare bulletin board corresponds to, S will be able to successfully distinguish the two cases for C and hence break Assumption 1. THEOREM 3.4 (MAIN THEOREM). We term the votes that are determined by the adversary "the adversarial votes" and the rest "the non-adversarial votes". Under the DDH assumption and that the ZKP primitive used in the protocol is secure, the DRE-i bulletin board does not reveal anything about the secrecy of the votes other than the tally of non-adversarial votes to an adversary that is able to determine an arbitrary number of votes.</p><p>PROOF. We first restrict our attention to the bare bulletin board and consider the additional ZKP and digital signatures later. To prove that the bare bulletin board does not reveal anything other than the tally of non-adversarial votes, we prove that given only a tally of non-adversarial votes t H and a set of adversarial votes {v k } k‚ààI A , a bare bulletin board can be simulated which is indistinguishable from any other bare bulletin board with the same non-adversarial vote tally and given adversarial votes. We do this in two steps: first, we show how to simulate a random bare bulletin board with the same t H and given adversarial votes; and second, we show that such a random bare bulletin board is indeed indistinguishable from any other bare bulletin board with the same non-adversarial vote tally and given adversarial votes.</p><p>Step 1. Given the adversarial votes {v k } k‚ààI A , we randomly choose the rest of the votes {v k } k / ‚ààI A such that their tally is t H . Choosing random values for x k for all k, we can simulate a bare bulletin board with {v k } k‚ààI A as the adversarial votes and {v k } k / ‚ààI A as the non-adversarial votes.</p><p>Step 2. Consider any two possible bare bulletin boards BB and BB ÒÆΩô with the same non-adversarial vote tally and given adversarial votes as above. First note that BB and BB ÒÆΩô have the same adversarial votes, they have the same adversarial vote tally t A , and since they have the same non-adversarial vote tally t H as well, they have the same total tally t = t H +t A . We know that any two bulletin boards with the same total tally (and hence BB and BB ÒÆΩô ) differ on an even number of votes. Let this vote difference between BB and BB ÒÆΩô be 2d. This means that with d swaps, one can get from one bare bulletin board to the other. Lemma 3.3 guarantees that in all these d steps, under Assumption 1, the two bare bulletin boards involved are indistinguishable to an adversary choosing {v k } k‚ààI A . Note that the adversarial votes remain fixed between the swaps. Furthermore, Assumption 1 is implied by DDH according to Lemma 3.1. Hence, a standard hybrid argument implies that the original bare bulletin boards (BB and BB ÒÆΩô ) are indistinguishable under the DDH assumption.</p><p>A secure 1-of-2 ZKP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Cramer et al. 1994]</ref>, by definition, does not reveal any information more than the one-bit truth of the statement: whether the ciphertext is a correct encryption of one of the two values. Hence, it does not reveal the secrecy of the encrypted value. The digital signatures serve to prove that all data published on the bulletin board are authentic; they are not related to the secrecy of votes. Hence, we conclude that the theorem holds for the full bulletin board.</p><p>The Theorem 3.4 guarantees the highest possible privacy level for DRE-i. To see this, note that the election tally is public in any election, and hence an adversary controlling a number of adversarial votes inevitably finds out the non-adversarial vote tally. The above theorem ensures that this inevitable knowledge is the only knowledge the adversary gains and in this sense proves the highest privacy level for DRE-i.</p><p>A corollary of the above theorem can be stated as below for a passive adversary that does not determine any votes, but only observes the bulletin board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COROLLARY 3.5 (PRIVACY AGAINST PASSIVE ADVERSARIES). Under the DDH assumption and that the ZKP primitive used in the protocol is secure, the DRE-i bulletin board does not reveal anything about the secrecy of the votes other than the tally of the votes to a passive adversary.</head><p>Although we have proven that encrypted votes in DRE-i are protected at the highest possible level, it is important to note that breaking encryption is not the only way to compromise ballot secrecy. There are other potentially more effective attacks, and security is determined by the weakest link in the chain. For example, an untrustworthy voting interface is one weak link in the chain; a corrupted interface can trivially disclose the voter's secret choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Karlof et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Estehghari and Desmedt 2010]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaum 2004]</ref> generally require a secure setup phase, in which TAs securely generate and distribute key shares. If the setup phase is compromised by attackers, then the secrecy of the vote will be breached. These issues also apply to DRE-i. On the other hand, in DRE-i even if the setup phase is completely corrupted, the tallying integrity will remain unaffected. This property is claimed for existing E2E verifiable protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Chaum et al. 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida et al. 2009]</ref>. We now explain how this also holds for DRE-i.</p><p>We will show DRE-i satisfies all the four integrity requirements as defined in Section 2.2, even if the setup phase is compromised. The use of the CDS technique (i.e., the 1-out-of-n Zero Knowledge Proof) ensures the correct format of the ballot <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Cramer et al. 1994]</ref>, and fulfills the first requirement. The second requirement is satisfied by the voter-initiated auditing (i.e., voter challenge), which is adopted in most verifiable e-voting protocols. The third requirement, that on transmission integrity, is satisfied by the voter being able to check the receipt against the public bulletin board. The fourth requirement, that on tallying integrity, is fulfilled by using homomorphic aggregation combined with the random-factor cancelation, so that anyone is able to verify the tally based on the audit data published on the public bulletin board without relying on any TA. In summary, if an insider attacker attempts to compromise the integrity of the election at any stage, this will most likely be caught by the public because the protocol is E2E verifiable <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaum et al. 2008a]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, it is important to ensure that a receipt does not reveal the voter's choice to a coercer. This is a property formally defined as "receipt-freeness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Delaune et al. 2006</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaum 2004]</ref> generally satisfy this requirement. We explain our protocol conforms to it too. As explained earlier, if the voter chooses to confirm her vote, the receipt does not leak any information about the choice made. If, on the other hand, the voter opts to cancel her vote, the receipt will reveal the selected choice, but the vote will be declared to be a dummy. A dummy vote is of course useless to a would-be coercer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Performance evaluation</head><p>In DRE-i, we pre-compute all random factors used for encryption before the election with the commitment published on the bulletin board. This pre-computation strategy, combined with the cancellation technique, is one key to realizing the "self-enforcing" property of the voting system. The same strategy also permits pre-computation of all cryptograms, hence optimizing the performance during voting.</p><p>We evaluate the system performance by starting from ballot generation. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref>, we need to compute g y i for each ballot. At first glance, this is very expensive, taking approximately n multiplications to compute g y 1 (recall that n is the total number of ballots, which may be hundreds of thousands). However, note that g y 2 = g y 1 ¬∑ g x 2 ¬∑ g x 1 . More generally, g y i = g y i‚àí1 ¬∑ g x i ¬∑ g x i‚àí1 for i &gt; 1. Thus, computing g y i , for i = 2, 3,. ..,n, incurs negligible cost.</p><p>For each ballot i, exponentiation is the predominant cost factor. It takes one exponentiation to compute g x i , one to compute g x i y i and four 2 to compute the 1-out-2 ZKP <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Cramer et al. 1996]</ref> for each no/yes vote, totalling ten exponentiations.</p><p>In the ballot casting stage, the computational cost incurred by the DRE machine is small. If we opt for the option of pre-computing all cryptograms before the election, the delay imposed of voting would be almost negligible, since the machine merely needs to print out the pre-computed cryptogram according to the voter's choice and sign it with the digital signature key. Obviously, pre-computing the cryptograms would mean we need to do more preparation work for an election, but that seems a worthwhile trade-off.</p><p>The data published on the bulletin board is universally verifiable. Anyone is able to check that the published random public keys g x i lie within the prime-order group, and that the values of g y i are correctly computed. To verify the ZKP for the published vote V i , it is necessary to first validate the order of V i . This requires an exponentiation (for both the valid and dummy cases); it takes a further four exponentiations to verify the 1-out-of-2 ZKP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Cramer et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cramer et al. 1996]</ref>. In total, it takes roughly 5 exponentiations to verify a ZKP. In principle, it suffices for at least one person to verify all the ZKPs in a batch (those who lost the election would be motivated to verify the tally).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Usability</head><p>As explained earlier in Section 2.1, there are three types of users in an e-voting system: ordinary voters, auditors and universal verifiers. In the DRE-i protocol, the auditing is voter-initiated, so an ordinary voter is also an auditor. Of course this does not preclude employing dedicated auditors in an election to perform auditing by casting dummy votes. A universal verifier is anyone in the world who has the technical expertise to verify all data on the public bulletin board in a batch operation.</p><p>For an e-voting system to be practically useful, it needs to be "usable". However the notion of "usability" can be abstract and elusive. Here, we define a "usable" cryptographic e-voting system as one that can be used independently by ordinary voters and auditors without requiring any cryptographic knowledge or relying on any trusted software. This is because in practice most people have no knowledge of cryptography and cannot distinguish trustworthy software from untrustworthy software.</p><p>The DRE-i protocol assumes a minimum technical background about the voter who may wish to audit the system. The auditing process has been seamlessly integrated into the natural confirm/cancel selection. Every voter can easily audit the ballot by simply choosing the "cancel" button. If a ballot is canceled, the voter just needs to verify that the printed candidate choice (in plain text) on the receipt is the same as that she chose previously. If not, she should lodge a protest immediately. This can be done without requiring any cryptographic knowledge. Of course, the voter needs to know how to open a web browser and check the bulletin board. This basic computer skill is also assumed in other verifiable e-voting protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Kiayias et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clarkson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adida 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chaum et al. 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaum et al. 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adida and Neff 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaum 2004]</ref>.</p><p>One may be concerned about the authenticity of the receipt and how to verify this. The data on the receipt should be authentic; otherwise, a dishonest voter may modify the receipt to support a protest that the data fail to match that on the bulletin board. Obviously, if we wish to assume the official receipt paper is physically unforgeable and any tampering with the printed data on the receipt will be visibly evident, then such an attack will not work. However, the assumption of the physical unforgeability is difficult to realize. In most cases, a digital signature would be needed, as in other e-voting protocols. With DRE-i, the voter does not have to verify the signature cryptographically; all she needs to do is to ensure the data on the receipt matches that on the bulletin board. A universal verifier will be able to verify all data on the bulletin board in a batch. We assume there is a facility provided at the polling station, say before the exit of the station, to allow voters to check the bulletin board. If the data is found not to match, the voter should raise the matter immediately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Dependability and fault tolerance</head><p>In DRE-i, the integrity of the election tally depends on the accuracy and completeness of the audit data. The DRE machine directly records votes just as the existing practice in real-world DRE deployment. At the end of the election, the machine reports the tally that it counts internally. But unlike the ordinary DRE machines, in DRE-i, the machine must publish additional audit data to allow public verification of the tally. If the audit data is corrupted (say some ballots are lost), then the integrity of the tally will be lost and the universal verification will fail. In that case, the system essentially degenerates to the existing unverifiable DRE-based e-voting. Here, we have considered the assurance of tallying integrity in the most stringent case, ensuring that every vote must be counted.</p><p>In a practical election, it is desirable to handle system faults gracefully. When the audit data have been found to be partially corrupted, instead of merely degenerating to unverifiable e-voting, we can extend the DRE-i protocol to provide a fail-safe feature.</p><p>Fail-safe DRE-i. Consider a case where a small subset L of ballots are found missing from (or to be corrupted on) the public bulletin board. (The number of the missing ballots should be insufficient to change the election outcome; otherwise, the act of error recovery may not be meaningful.) We assume the DRE machine still maintains the x i secrets in the protected memory of the tamperresistant module. To allow the tallying verification to proceed, one trivial solution is to re-publish the cryptograms of the subset L of ballots as if they were "dummy" votes. The no-votes (g x i y i for i ‚àà L) are then included into the tallying process, hence allowing the tally of the remaining ballots to be verified. However, if a voter holds a receipt of a missing ballot, the secrecy of that ballot will be lost. Hence, instead of publishing individual cryptograms, it is more secure to publish just one aggregate value: namely, A = ‚àë i‚ààL g x i y i together with some cryptographic proofs to show that A is in the correct format (details can be found in Appendix A). Thus, the information leakage is minimal. An attacker in possession of some (not all) receipts cannot learn anything about the missing ballots. In the worst case when the attacker is able to collect all receipts of the missing ballots, the only thing he can learn is the tally of the missing ballots, not any individual vote.</p><p>Distributed DRE-i. The fail-safe mechanism works on the condition that the x i secrets are available. If the DRE machine is physically damaged or lost, such an error recovery procedure may no longer be possible. In order to ensure system robustness, it is desirable to implement DRE-i in a distributed way, as we explain below. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows one possible implementation of the DRE-i system using a distributed client-server architecture. The system consists of touch-screen DRE clients and a back-end server cluster. The DRE client interacts with the voter and records the vote directly as usual. The server cluster consists of n servers and implements a k/n threshold control. The setup phase works based on a proactive secret sharing scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Herzberg et al. 1995]</ref>. Each server generates a random polynomial of degree t ‚àí 1 and distributes n shares to all servers. All n polynomials are then added up with no single server knowing the aggregate secret. Let the aggregate secret be x i . The process can be repeated for all x i where i = 1,. ..,n. Subsequently, the server cluster jointly compute g x i by performing secret reconstruction on the exponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Herzberg et al. 1995]</ref>, such that no single server learns the exponent x i . To finish the setup phase, the server cluster publishes all the g x i values on the bulletin board as commitment. During the voting phrase, the DRE client queries the shares from k honest severs in the server cluster through secure channels and reconstructs the x i secret. With x i , the client is able to compute the cryptogram and print the receipt accordingly. The DRE client erases the transient x i secret immediately after its use.  A further practical strategy in distributing the implementation of DRE-i is to divide the nationalscale tallying into a set of smaller-scale tallying processes, each implementing an independent DRE-i system. This is consistent with many real-world elections where tallies are calculated at relatively small (say county or precinct) scales and then added up.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RELATED WORK AND COMPARISON</head><p>In this section, we compare DRE-i with previous DRE-based voting protocols in a local supervised voting environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Categorization of e-voting</head><p>First of all, we take a broad view at the existing e-voting protocols. There are generally two categories of cryptographic voting protocols: decentralized and centralized (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>. The former includes boardroom voting protocols due to Kiayias-Yung [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kiayias and Yung 2002]</ref> . All these E2E verifiable protocols require external tallying authorities to decrypt and tally the submitted votes. Hence, they belong to the category of "TA-based e-voting" (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>.</p><p>The proposed DRE-i protocol provides the same E2E verifiability, but without involving any external tallying authorities. This puts DRE-i in a new category, which we call "self-enforcing e-voting". Notes: Major differences are highlighted in bold face.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Comparison with unverifiable DRE</head><p>We first compare DRE-i with the unverifiable (or black-box) DRE machines that have been widely deployed around the world. The results of the comparison are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table IV</ref>. We explain the main differences below.</p><p>Integrity. The primary advantage of DRE-i lies in the additional "-i" in the name: i.e., its integrity. In DRE-i, a voter can verify that her ballot is recorded to the correct candidate through voterinitiated auditing (i.e., ballot casting integrity). She can further verify that the recorded ballot is correctly transmitted to the tallying unit by checking the receipt against the public bulletin board (i.e., transmission integrity). Finally, every voter is able to verify the integrity of the tally based on the public audit data published on the bulletin board (i.e., ballot tallying integrity). These essential verification procedures are missing in the currently deployed DRE machines.</p><p>Ballot secrecy and voter privacy. In both systems, the touch-screen interface can violate the secrecy of the vote. However, it does not know the voter's real identity. Hence, the voter's privacy is protected through anonymity. In DRE-i, the system requires an additional setup phase, which prefixes random factors used for encryption. The secrecy of the random factors needs to be securely protected, as well as the pre-computed cryptograms (if the pre-computation option is enabled).</p><p>Receipt. In DRE-i, the machine prints out a receipt, which the voter can verify against a public bulletin board. The receipt does not reveal how a voter had voted, but allows the voter to check if her vote has indeed been included into the tallying process. By contrast, the ordinary DRE machine does not provide any receipt. If the ballot is missing or miscounted, the voter would not be able to know.</p><p>Tamper-resistant module. In DRE-i, a tamper-resistant module (e.g., smart card or TPM chip) is needed to securely manage sensitive key material, including the private signing key, the x i secrets and pre-computed cryptograms (if any). This follows the standard industry practice for key management <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Anderson 2008]</ref>. However, an ordinary DRE machine normally does not require a tamper-resistant module, as no cryptography is used.</p><p>Usability. As compared to the ordinary DRE, the usability in DRE-i degrades slightly due to the additional opportunity provided to the voter to check the receipt against the bulletin board. On the other hand, the receipts allow public verification of the tallying integrity, which is not possible with ordinary DRE machines. Hence, the trade-off seems worthwhile for the improved assurance on integrity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Comparison with previous DRE-based E2E verifiable schemes</head><p>Next, we compare DRE-i with two previous DRE-based E2E verifiable voting protocols: MarkPledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Adida and Neff 2006]</ref> and Chaum's visual crypto scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004]</ref>. The results of this comparison are summarized in Table V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrity. DRE-i provides the same E2E verifiability as MarkPledge [Adida and Neff 2006] and</head><p>Chaum's scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004</ref>], but without involving any external tallying authorities. To guarantee the tallying integrity, all three protocols require the audit data as published on the bulletin board be accurate and complete. In MarkPledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Adida and Neff 2006]</ref> and Chaum's scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004]</ref>, when the election is finished, the audit data published on the bulletin board must be first decrypted by external tallying authorities before any verification is possible. This requires that the tallying authorities' private keys be available at the decryption and tallying phase; otherwise, the tally cannot be verified.</p><p>Ballot secrecy and voter privacy. In all three protocols, if the voting interface is corrupted, the secrecy of the ballot is lost. In addition, if the setup process (be it the pre-computation procedure in DRE-i or the secret sharing setup in TA-based e-voting) is compromised, the secrecy of the ballot is lost too. In DRE-i, all random factors are pre-determined before the election with commitment published on the bulletin board. The secrecy of the pre-determined random factors needs to be securely protected, which can be realized by storing them in the secure memory of a tamper-resistant module <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Anderson 2008]</ref>. In MarkPledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Adida and Neff 2006]</ref> and Chaum's scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004]</ref>, the random factors are generated by the DRE machine on the fly during the encryption of ballots. Similarly, the secrecy of those random factors needs to be protected. It is critically important that the random factors are generated honestly from a secure random number generator. If the random number generator is corrupted, all random factors are effectively leaked. Consequently, the secrecy of all encrypted votes is trivially lost (which is orthogonal to the security of the TAs' private keys). In DRE-i, the choice of pre-computing random factors before the election is based on the assumption that the environment in the setup phase is more controllable than that in the field deployment on the election day, hence the random number generator is less likely to be corrupted. Finally, MarkPledge [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adida and Neff 2006]</ref> and Chaum's scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004</ref>] assume the external TAs do not leak their private keys; otherwise, the secrecy of the votes is compromised.</p><p>Availability. All three protocols depend on the robustness of hardware and software to ensure availability of functionality. In MarkPledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Adida and Neff 2006]</ref> and Chaum's scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004]</ref>, the tallying process is entirely reliant on the external tallying authorities. All data is encrypted under the authorities' keys and there is usually no mechanism of directly recording votes by the machine. However, this dependence on external authorities may lead to an additional, in fact a catastrophic, failure mode. Human nature being what it is, when a security system critically depends on a few selected human beings as authorities, they may form the weakest link in the system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Anderson 2008]</ref>. Suppose that when the national voting is finished, tallying authorities claim that their private keys are lost <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Karlof et al. 2005</ref>] (e.g., as victims of targeted attacks or as the au-thorities claim such is the case). All the data on the bulletin board will be useless, and the whole election may have to be aborted as a result. (Recall that in the Helios election <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Adida et al. 2009]</ref>, all the tallying authorities' private keys were centrally backed up at a trusted third party to ensure availability.)</p><p>Tamper-resistant module. In DRE-i, a tamper-resistant module is required to securely manage sensitive key material, including the private signing key, the pre-determined random factors and the pre-computed cryptograms (if any). In MarkPledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Adida and Neff 2006]</ref> and Chaum's scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004</ref>], a tamper-resistant module is also required, for safeguarding the private signing key, and additionally, for protecting the ephemeral random factors that are generated as part of the encryption process. Because of the pre-generation of random factors, DRE-i requires more memory in the tamper-resistant module than the other two schemes.</p><p>Usability. In MarkPledge, the voter needs to supply a "short-string challenge" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Adida and Neff 2006]</ref>, which demands special cryptographic knowledge. To address this limitation, the designers of the MarkPledge system suggest having a trusted third party at the polling station to issue the challenges on the voters' behalf. Unfortunately, this means a voter will not be able to independently perform auditing. In Chaum's visual crypto scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Chaum 2004]</ref>, the voter needs to choose one of the two transparencies for auditing. However, this implicitly assumes that voters understand how visual cryptography works. In practice, not many voters can grasp the concept of visual cryptography <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Karlof et al. 2005]</ref>. As explained in Section 3.3, by design, DRE-i is free from these issues. In all three protocols, a universal verifier who has necessary computing expertise is required to verify the audit data published on the bulletin board in one batch operation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Comparison with alternative designs</head><p>The design of the DRE-i protocol is motivated by the observation that since the touch-screen DRE learns the voter's choice directly and generates random factors for encryption on its own, the involvement of external tallying authorities does not seem strictly necessary for realizing the E2E verifiability. It is worth stressing that there are several ways to construct a "self-enforcing e-voting" protocol and DRE-i is just one of them. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss all possible alternative designs, we will briefly describe one scheme and then compare it with DRE-i.</p><p>In order to avoid the involvement of external tallying authorities, one straightforward solution is to adapt the existing TA-based e-voting protocols by merging the functions of the DRE with those of the TAs. For instance, the system may use a single TA and keep the private key in the protected memory of the tamper-resistant module in the DRE machine. All votes are encrypted under the TA's public key on the fly using the standard ElGamal encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[Kiayias et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Clarkson et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adida 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adida et al. 2009]</ref> with ciphertext printed on the receipt and also published on the bulletin board. At the end of the election, the DRE machine decrypts the published ciphertext in a verifiable way.</p><p>The DRE-i protocol is better than the above alternative design in two main aspects. The first is efficiency. In DRE-i, the ciphertext for the no-vote (g x i y i ) and the yes-vote (g x i y i ¬∑ g) consists of a single group element. It takes merely one exponentiation to compute it. By comparison, using the standard ElGamal encryption, it takes two exponentiations to encrypt a vote and the resultant ciphertext consists of two group elements. Second, in DRE-i, all the random factors used in the encryption are fixed before the election with commitment published on the bulletin board, while they are determined on the fly during voting in the alternative design. Our assumption is that the environment in the setup phase is more controllable than that in the field deployment on the election day. Furthermore, the publication of all random public keys (g x i ) before the election gives the public an opportunity to verify the distribution of the values, gaining some measure about the randomness. Another practical advantage of pre-fixing the random factors is to allow pre-computing the cryptograms, thus reducing the latency in voting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>E2E verifiable e-voting protocols have been extensively studied in the past twenty years, but the real-world deployment of those protocols has been limited. Our hypothesis is that a key obstacle to the practical deployment is the existing E2E verifiable voting protocols' universal dependence on a set of trustworthy tallying authorities to administer the tallying process. Previous trial experience has shown that implementing such authorities is not an easy task in practice. In this paper, we focus on studying local touch-screen DRE-based elections. First of all, we observe that since the DRE machine learns the voter's choice directly and generates its own random factors for encryption, the involvement of external tallying authorities does not seem strictly necessary for achieving the E2E verifiability. Based on this observation, we propose a self-enforcing e-voting protocol called DRE-i, which provides the same E2E verifiability as previous schemes but without involving any tallying authorities. By comparing DRE-i with related voting systems, we demonstrate encouraging improvements in several aspects, including security, efficiency and usability. This shows that "self-enforcing e-voting", as a new paradigm, has promising potential for further research. In future research, we plan to extend our study to remote e-voting and also to accommodate more complex voting schemes, such as Single Transferable Vote (STV).</p><p>(g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc , g ab ),</p><p>(g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc , R), (g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc , R ÒÆΩô g), and <ref type="figure">(g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc , g ab g)</ref>, for random a, b, c, R, and R ÒÆΩô . 3DDH guarantees that the first and second tuples are indistinguishable. The second and third tuples have the exact same distribution and hence are indistinguishable. 3DDH also guarantees that the third and fourth tuples are indistinguishable. Hence, the first and fourth tuples, i.e. <ref type="figure">(g, g a , g b , g c , g</ref> ac , g bc , g abc , g ab ) and (g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc , g ab+1 ) are indistinguishable.</p><p>LEMMA A.2. Consider two failsafe DRE-i elections in which all the votes are exactly the same except for two votes v i and v j which are swapped between the two elections. Under Assumption 2, the bare bulletin boards of the above two elections are indistinguishable to an adversary that determines an arbitrary number of the votes other than v i and v j .</p><p>PROOF. Let us assume w.l.o.g. that i &lt; j. If v i = v j , the lemma holds trivially. In the following we give a proof for v i ÒÆΩô = v j .</p><p>Let us assume there is an adversary A that first chooses an arbitrary number of the votes other than v i and v j , and eventually distinguishes the two elections. We construct an algorithm S that uses A to break Assumption 2.</p><p>Given a tuple (g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc ,C), where C equals either g ab or g ab+1 , S sets up the bulletin board with the generator g as follows. Let I = {1,. ..,n} \ {i, j}. g x k and g y k are set up in the same way as the proof of Lemma 3.3. First, S chooses n ‚àí 2 random values x k for all k ‚àà I. S sets g x i ‚Üê g a , g x j ‚Üê g b , and calculates g x k for all k ‚àà I. Note that we implicitly have x i = a and x j = b. Let s 1 = ‚àë k&lt;i x k , s 2 = ‚àë i&lt;k&lt; j x k , and s 3 = ‚àë k&gt; j x k . S also calculates s 1 , s 2 , and s 3 and then computes œÉ i = s 1 ‚àí s 2 ‚àí s 3 and œÉ j = s 1 + s 2 ‚àí s 3 . Now given all g x k , all g y k can be computed accordingly. Note that we implicitly have:  S then gives A the constructed bare bulletin board as input. If A is able to distinguish which of the above two cases the given bare bulletin board corresponds to, S will be able to successfully distinguish the two cases for C and hence break Assumption 2. THEOREM A.3 (MAIN THEOREM). Under the DDH assumption and that the ZKP primitives used in the protocol are secure, the failsafe DRE-i bulletin board does not reveal anything about the secrecy of the votes other than the tally of non-adversarial votes to an adversary that determines an arbitrary number of votes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">y i = ‚àë k&lt;i x k ‚àí ‚àë k&gt;i x k = s 1 ‚àí (s 2 + b + s 3 ) = œÉ i ‚àí b y j = ‚àë k&lt;</formula><p>PROOF. Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.4, whereas now we rely on Lemmas A.1 and A.2 instead.</p><p>A corollary of the above theorem can be stated as below for a passive adversary that does not determine any votes, but only observes the bulletin board. COROLLARY A.4 (PRIVACY AGAINST PASSIVE ADVERSARIES). Under the assumptions that DDH is intractable and the ZKP primitives used in the protocol are secure, the failsafe DRE-i bulletin board does not reveal anything about the secrecy of the votes other than the tally of the votes to a passive adversary.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Fig. 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. FAIL-SAFE DRE-I AND SECURITY PROOFS</head><p>We use the same domain parameters, (p, q, g), as those defined in Section 2. Assume at the end of the election, a subset L of ballots are found to be missing (or corrupted) on the bulletin board. To allow the public to verify the tally of the remaining ballots, the DRE publishes A = g ‚àë i‚ààL x i y i and proves non-interactively that A is in the right format without revealing the secrecy of each individual g x i y i term as follows.</p><p>(1) DRE chooses r ‚àà R [1, q ‚àí 1] and publishes X i = (g x i ) r and Z i = (g x i y i ) r for all i ‚àà L. (2) DRE publishes ZKPs of Equality (based on Chaum-Pedersen's technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Chaum and Pedersen 1993]</ref>) for all i ‚àà L to prove that the discrete logarithm of X i with respect to base g x i is equal to the discrete logarithm of X j with respect to base g x j , where j is the index in L immediately greater than i. These ZKPs guarantee that for any i, j ‚àà L (i ÒÆΩô = j), X i = (g x i ) r and X j = (g y i ) r have the same exponent r. (3) DRE publishes ZKPs of Equality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Chaum and Pedersen 1993]</ref> for all i ‚àà L to prove that (X i , g y i , Z i ) forms a DDH tuple. This is equivalent to proving that the discrete logarithm of Z i with respect to base g y i is equal to the discrete logarithm of X i with respect to base g. These ZKPs guarantee that for all i ‚àà L, Z i = (g x i y i ) r has the same exponent r. (4) DRE publishes a ZKP of Equality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Chaum and Pedersen 1993]</ref> to prove that the discrete logarithm of ‚àè i‚ààL Z i with respect to base A is equal to the discrete logarithm of an arbitrary X i (i ‚àà L) with respect to base g x i . It suffices to choose i to be the first index in L. This ZKP guarantees that A is indeed represented in the form of g ‚àë i‚ààL x i y i .</p><p>These published data guarantee that A is in the correct representation. Therefore A can be subsequently included into the tallying process to rectify the effects of missing ballots. Among the published data, the ZKP of Equality does not leak anything more than one bit information about the truth of the statement: the two discrete logarithms are equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Chaum and Pedersen 1993]</ref>. However, the process also involves publishing additional data: X i and Z i for all i ‚àà L. In the following, we will prove that the X i and Z i values will not affect the secrecy of each individual g x i y i . In other words, the result in Theorem 3.4 still holds. We consider the extreme case when the available data to an adversary is the maximum: i.e., L is a whole set rather than a subset (obviously, |L| &gt; 1). We will prove Theorem 3.4 holds even in this extreme case. First of all, we define a variant of the DDH assumption as below.</p><p>ASSUMPTION 2 (3DDH VARIANT). For a generator g and randomly chosen a, b, and c, given a tuple <ref type="figure">(g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc ,C</ref>) in which C is either g ab or g ab+1 , it is hard to decide whether C = g ab or C = g ab+1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LEMMA A.1. Assumption 2 is implied by the DDH assumption.</head><p>PROOF. First, note that Steiner, Tsudik, and Waidner <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[Steiner et al. 1996]</ref> have proven that DDH is equivalent to the generalized DDH assumption. An instance of the generalized DDH assumption is the three-party DDH assumption (3DDH) which states that for a generator g and randomly chosen a, b, and c, given a tuple (g, g a , g b , g c , g ab , g ac , g bc ), it is hard to distinguish g abc from random. An equivalent formulation of the 3DDH assumption is as follows: for a generator g and randomly chosen a, b, and c, given a tuple (g, g a , g b , g c , g ac , g bc , g abc ), it is hard to distinguish g ab from random. This can be easily seen by considering g c as the generator in the original formulation. Now we prove that the latter formulation of 3DDH implies Assumption 2. Similar to the proof of Lemma 3.1, consider the following tuples:</p></div>			</div>
