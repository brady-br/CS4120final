For deletes, however, BetrFS issues an upsert for every file block, which had little impact on the BetrFS footprint because stale data is lazily reclaimed. After flushing, there was less than 3GiB of disk overhead, regardless of the amount of live data.

Because BetrFS does not include a layer of indirection from pathname to data, renaming requires copying all data and metadata to new points in the tree. We also measured large-file renames, and saw similarly large overheads-a function of the number of blocks in the file. Although there are known solutions to this problem, such as by adding a layer of indirection, we plan to investigate techniques that can preserve the appealing lexicographic locality without sacrificing rename and delete performance.</p></div>
