				<p>Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is becoming more and more popular for automobile academic and industry community. Communication mechanisms play an important role in CAVs applications and services. However, lack of detailed comparison of different communication mechanisms is the main obstacle for the deployment of CAVs applications and services. In this paper, we set up an end-to-end prototype which supports WiFi, LTE, and DSRC based communications and evaluate the performance in latency, power dissipation, and system utilization. Three observations are summarized for the real deployment of VEC applications.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Due to the safety and efficiency in fuel consumption, autonomous driving techniques have attracted huge attention from both the academic and industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, the global autonomous driving market is expected grow up to $173.15B by 2030. However, there are still several challenges in the development and deployment of the autonomous driving system. The first challenge is on the cost. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>, the cost of a level 4 autonomous driving vehicle can attain 300,000 dollars, in which the sensors and computing platform cost almost 200,000 dollars. The second challenge is the real-time requirements of the sensing, perception, and decision. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, when the vehicle drives at 40 km per hour in urban areas and that autonomous functions should be effective every 1 meter, the execution of each realtime task should be less than 100ms. However, limited by the performance of perception algorithms and the stochastic run time on the computing platform, how to guarantee the real-time requirement of the safety-critical system is still an open question. The third challenge is the reliability of cameras and LiDAR under severe weather conditions. The quality of images captured by cameras is affected by the lighting conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref> while the point clouds from LiDAR can be affected by noisy and sparse. In order to address the above challenges, vehicle-toeverything (V2X) based vehicle edge computing attracts more and more attention. V2X enables the vehicle to obtain realtime traffic information from the Road Side Unit (RSU), which helps to decrease the cost of sensors on an autonomous driving vehicle. Meanwhile, there would be less sensing and perception tasks with real-time requirements and the reliability of cameras and LiDAR would not be a issue any more. Building intelligent traffic infrastructures with complex computation and communication resources become a consensus of the transportation community for the future transportation system.</p><p>For the state-of-the-art of VEC, lots of works are focused on task offloading algorithms to optimize the usage of the V2X communications resources. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, a joint offloading decision and resource allocation model is designed to optimize the performance of task offloading when the computation requirement is unknown. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> proposes a service caching and task offloading model to optimize the cost of the computation while <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> considers the offloading problems for the energy efficiency. However, all these works are based on simulations and the evaluation in real environment is missing.</p><p>Besides, for the edge computing enabled application prototypes discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>, the communication mechanisms are limited to WiFi. Other potential communication mechanisms like LTE and DSRC are not touched. A general and comprehensive comparison of different types of V2X communication mechanisms for VEC applications is still missing.</p><p>In this paper, we set up a VEC prototype which supports three typical V2X communications including WiFi, LongTerm Evolution (LTE), and Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC). We set up dedicated end-to-end WiFi communication through a router, an LTE communication using Software Defined Radio (SDR) device USRP B210 boards with wireless antennas, and a DSRC communication using commercial products with On-Board Unit (OBU) and RoadSide Unit (RSU). On top of the prototype, several applications including Robot Operating System (ROS), Socket, and Ping messages are implemented to evaluate the performance of the communication as well as their impacts to the computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>. The evaluation covers the round-trip latency, system utilization, and power dissipation. We summarize several observations towards the usability, availability, and efficiency of the V2X communications to the VEC applications. The contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comparison of communication mechanisms of LTE, WiFi, and DSRC using real VEC applications.</p><p>• An end-to-end communication prototype is built which can support LTE, DSRC, and WiFi. On top of the prototype, ROS, Socket, and Ping messages are implemented.</p><p>• We evaluated the communication prototype in latency, power dissipation, and system utilization and get three observations for the real deployment of VEC applications.</p><p>The remainder of paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 depict the motivation and methodology for the communication-computation comparison, respectively. We present the comparison results in Section 4, and summarize the paper in the last section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Motivation</head><p>Considering a typical VEC scenario showing in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the cloud, base station (BS), RSU, and vehicles are connected through a three-tier communication network. The bottom tier is for vehicles, where vehicles can share information through DSRC, LTE, as well as WiFi. The middle tier includes the BS and RSU. Vehicles communicate with the RSU through LTE, DSRC, and LTE while they can also communicate with the BS through LTE. The top tier is the cloud data center. Both BS and RSU are connected to the cloud through Ethernet or optical fiber connections. <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> shows a brief comparison of LTE, DSRC, and WiFi in terms of frequency and max range. In practical, DSRC is designed for sharing information between vehicles and traffic infrastructure. There are seven lists the fifteen message types that are defined in the SAE J2735 standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, which covers information like the vehicle's position, map information, emergence warning, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>. Limited by the available bandwidth, DSRC messages have small size and low frequency. However, DSRC provides reliable communication even When the vehicle is driving 120 miles per hour. In contrast, WiFi and LTE provides more bandwidth but performs poor in mobile environment. The coverage is another concern when implementing the V2X application. Due to the mobile cellular network technology, LTE is the best in terms of coverage while DSRC also achieves almost 1000 meters' coverage with the speed at 120 mph. The coverage of WiFi shows different for indoor and outdoor scenarios. For 802.11ac, it achieves 46 meters for indoor scenario while 92 meters for outdoor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>In order to compare the performance of different V2X communication mechanisms and evaluate their impact to the computation, we build an end-to-end prototype which supports WiFi, LTE, and DSRC. In this section, first we discuss their setups, then we discuss the communication messages defined for the comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Hardware Description</head><p>For wifi-based communication, a TPlink router is used to set up a hotspots. The router supports two frequency band: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. For LTE-based communication, two Ettus Research USRP B210 boards with two VERT2450 antennas are used with uhd software driver to set up the network. For DSRC-based communication, we use moKar DSRC devices with two DSRC antennas in the prototype.</p><p>All the communications antennas/devices are connected to a host machine to handle the communication and application development. For the on-board computing boards, we use Intel Fog Reference and Nvidia Jetson TX2. The Intel Fog Reference has 8 Intel Xeon(R) CPU with 3.60GHz frequency. And it has 32GB memory. Jetson TX2 is a typical mobile computing board with GPU installed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. For RSU, a cluster of Intel Fog Reference boards are connected to provide computation as well as communication resources to vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. NVIDIA R Jetson TX2 is a power-efficient embedded AI computing platform which has dual-core Denver and quad-core ARM R Cortex-A57 CPU equipped with 8GB DDR4 memory and 32GB eMMC. The GPU on Jetson TX2 is powered by NVIDIA Pascal <ref type="bibr">TM</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">WiFi-based Communication</head><p>As one of the most popular wireless communications for large volume of data transmission, WiFi is a potential communication methods for VEC applications. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the communication framework implemented on top of WiFi. When OBU and RSU connected to the router, unique IP addresses are assigned and they are able to Ping each other within the local area network. In this paper, we use 5GHz WiFi connection. On top of the WiFi connection, we implement a ROS-based communication for data sharing. ROS is a communication middleware designed for robots as well as connected and autonomous driving vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>. In ROS, a master is launched to manage all the ROS nodes, topics, services, and actions. roscore is used to launch the ROS master in RSU. Two ROS nodes are launched in both RSU and OBU: talker, listener. They are defined to send ROS messages between RSU and OBU through Inter-Process Communication (IPC). fined Radio (SDR), the programmability of the wireless communication devices improves a lot and it becomes easier to set up a dedicated LTE communication testbed using SDR boards with open sourced software like OpenAirInterface and srsLTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>. In our prototype, the LTE communication is set up by using two Ettus Research USRP B210 boards with VERT2450 antennas <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>. USRP B210 boards are connected to the host machine through USB 3.0 interface. For the software, uhd is built as the USRP driver and srsLTE is installed to build the whole LTE network. srsLTE is an free and open-source 4G/LTE software suite which includes core network (EPC), base station (eNB), and user equipment (UE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. All the modems can be implemented as an application running in a standard Linux-based machine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">LTE-based Communication</head><p>As is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, EPC and eNB are implemented on the RSU because they need to provide LTE connections to all nearby vehicles. UE is implemented on the OBU for registration and connection to the eNB. To begin with, EPC with eNB are launched to broadcast signals at a specific frequency. After UE is launched on another machine, it will search for the area to find the cellular tower and try to set up connection. When the UE is registered in EPC and connected with the eNB, an unique IP address will be assigned to the UE. For example, a virtual network interface is implement by eNB on the RSU (172.16.0.1) and it assigns 172.16.0.2 to the UE. With unique IP addresses in the local area network, RSU and OBU can ping each other and the networking programming interface can be used for application development. Similar to WiFi, the data sharing application is also implemented based on ROS. ROS master with talker and listener ROS nodes are implemented on the RSU while talker and listener ROS nodes are implemented on the OBU. We use the default frequency of srsLTE called EARFCN 3400 with single VERT 2450 antenna, which represents the download link with 2685MHz and upload link with 2565MHz. For both of RSPC and OBPC, two ROS nodes named talker and listener are created. talker reports information of vessel, such as latitude, longitude, heading and speed at frequency of 250Hz while listener subscribes to it with the same frequency. TCP Socket-based communication is setup between host machines and DSRC devices. The RSU_device and OBU_device communicate with each other through DSRC to share BSM messages at 250Hz.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">DSRC-based Communication</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Comparison and Observation</head><p>In order to evaluate the performance of the end-to-end communication prototype, we conducted experiments and evaluated in three aspects: end-to-end latency, power dissipation, and system utilization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">End-to-end Latency</head><p>End-to-end latency is one of the most important metric to evaluate the performance of applications which heavily relies on the communication. In this part, latency is measured in two directions: from RSU to OBU and from OBU to RSU.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1 and Table 2</ref>. From RSU to OBU, LTE performs the best for BSM and Ping while WiFi is better for two image messages. From OBU to RSU, DSRC is the best for BSM message. For LTE-based communication, we notice that LTE performs better than WiFi for BSM and Ping but worse for image. In addition, DSRC shows stable performance in transmitting small messages. Besides the average end-to-end delay, we also draw the CDF of the end-to-end delay in two directions for transmitting BSM message, which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. We can find that WiFi shows large variance for RSU to OBU (over 300ms) while LTE shows large variance for OBU to RSU (almost 100ms). We think one reason for the variation of LTE is the bandwidth difference of downloading and uploading. The variance of DSRC is always the lowest which means the latency of DSRC is very stable.</p><p>In order to measure the latency in mobile environment, HydraOne is also used in the experiments to communicate with the RSU <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. We choose BSM message and measure   From the results shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, DSRC shows the lowest difference when the speed of HydraOne changes, while LTE's latency increased by over 300 times when the speed increases from 0 to 5 m/s. For WiFi-based communication, negligible difference is observed when the speed changes. From the discussion above, we can generalize our first observation: Observation 1: DSRC shows fast and reliable performance for transmitting predefined messages. WiFi has the lowest latency when transmitting images but its variance for BSM and ping is large. LTE performs well for small messages like BSM and ping but bad for large messages like images. LTE and DSRC have stable performance under mobile environment while LTE has the most performance degradation. A communication mechanism which can provide sufficient and stable bandwidth is still missing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Power Dissipation</head><p>For the measurement of power dissipation, Watt's Up Pro is used to record the hardware power dissipation and rapl tool from Intel is used to measure the processor power dissipation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. Since both OBU and RSU can be sender and receiver, we measure the power dissipation for communication connection and message transmission in four cases, which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>From the results, we can find that WiFi is always more energy efficient than LTE and DSRC. For the transmission of BSM message, DSRC has the most energy consumption for most cases and they are all larger than 16W. In addition to </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">System Utilization</head><p>For the measurement of system utilization, we use top to get the memory footprint and the CPU utilization. The results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 6, 7</ref>, 8, and 9 (in Section 5). It can be found that DSRC has the lowest memory footprint and CPU utilization for BSM message, while LTE has less memory footprint and CPU utilization when RSU is the receiver. For WiFi, the memory footprint and CPU utilization is higher than others except when RSU is sending image message.</p><p>In addition to the system utilization for sending messages, there are also some overhead in setting up the communications. On RSU, the extra overhead includes launching ROS master node through roscore and launching the EPC with eNB for LTE communications. On OBU, UE needs to be launched for LTE connection. The results for the above overhead are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. We can find that ROS master does not consume a lot memory footprint but eNB and UE consume large memory footprint and CPU resources. This fact leads to the following observation:</p><p>Observation 3: Sending process consumes more memory footprint and CPU resources than receiving. The usage of srsLTE as well as ROS introduces non-negligible system overhead.</p></div>

Since time difference affects the latency results, we set up 
Network Time Protocol (NTP) based time synchronization 
and use clockdiff in Linux to measure the clock difference 
when transmitting messages. Then the clock difference is 
applied calculate the end-to-end latency. The results of the 
average end-to-end delay are shown in </table></figure>

the data transmission, communication setup/connection also 
consumes a lot of energy. The connection of LTE consumes 
8.6W for OBU and 16.5W for RSU, which is the power over-
head of setting up EPC and eNB on RSU and UE on the OBU. 
Beside, transmitting image messages consumes more energy 
than others. On sender's side, the power dissipation for image 
sending is larger than 18.5W. This fact leads to the following 
observation: 
Observation 2: There are non-negligible power dissipa-
tion for communication connections for LTE and DSRC. Since 
sending messages also consumes lot of energy, how to make 
the V2X communication more energy efficient is still an open 
question.
