				<p>DCAC is a practical OS-level access control system that supports application-defined principals. It allows normal users to perform administrative operations within their privilege, enabling isolation and privilege separation for applications. It does not require centralized policy specification or management, giving applications freedom to manage their principals while the policies are still enforced by the OS. DCAC uses hierarchically-named attributes as a generic framework for user-defined policies such as groups defined by normal users. For both local and networked file systems, its execution time overhead is between 0%-9% on file system microbenchmarks, and under 1% on applications. This paper shows the design and implementation of DCAC, as well as several real-world use cases, including sandboxing applications, enforcing server applica-tions&apos; security policies, supporting NFS, and authenticating user-defined sub-principals in SSH, all with minimal code changes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Continued high-profile computer security failures and data breaches demonstrate that computer security for applications is abysmal. While there is extensive research into novel security and access control models little of this work has an impact on practice. Instead of applications consistently reimplementing security vulnerabilities, they need a practical and expressive way to use thoroughly debugged system-level primitives to achieve best security practices. DCAC (DeCentralized Access Control) is our attempt to make modern security mechanisms practical for access control. It has three distinguishing characteristics: it is decentralized in privilege, decentralized in policy specification, and allows application-defined principals and synchronization requirements. Although DCAC greatly increases the flexibility of access control, it retains a familiar model of operation, with per-process metadata checked against per-object ACLs to determine the allowed access. It relies on the standard OS infrastructure of a hierarchical file namespace, extended file attributes, and file descriptors. It is practical for distributed environments because it avoids requiring centralized storage, consistency, or management. * Work completed while at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>Decentralized privilege. In Linux and Windows, users and groups are principals, and can be assigned privileges. A user might consider creating another user (a "subprincipal") and assigning it a subset of her privileges. This allows an application to run as the sub-principal, and thus with restricted privileges compared to the case where the user directly runs the application. However, on Linux and Windows, administrative functions on users and groups require root privilege. As a result, current OSlevel access control does not allow many applications to run with least privilege.</p><p>DCAC decentralizes administrator privilege: a normal user can perform administrative operations within her privilege, like creating principals with subsets of her privilege. Privilege separation makes complex applications more difficult to exploit. But current systems require administrative involvement to install and deploy privilege-separated software.</p><p>For example, the suEXEC feature of Apache HTTP Server allows it to run CGI and SSI programs under UIDs different from the UID of the calling web server, by using setuid binaries. However, creating UIDs for CGI/SSI programs and setting up the setuid binaries requires administrator privilege. Not only can use of administrative privilege require human involvement, it also adds opportunities for configuration mistakes that can actually harm security. The suEXEC documentation 1 warns the user, "if suEXEC is improperly configured, it can cause any number of problems and possibly create new holes in your computer's security. If you aren't familiar with managing setuid root programs and the security issues they present, we highly recommend that you not consider using suEXEC." By contrast, DCAC allows forms of privilege separation, like delegating user privileges to sub-principals, that even in the case of a configuration mistake, limit the effect of a compromise to the privileges of the original user.</p><p>Decentralized policy specification. OS-level access control typically defines its principals and policies in a centralized, secure location, such as the /etc/group file, the policy.conf file in SELinux, or a central policy server (e.g., a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server). DCAC decentralizes policy specification: policies are stored in files and file metadata at arbitrary locations. DCAC generalizes the setuid mechanism of Unix, allowing processes to use the file system to gain fine-grained, user-defined privileges (i.e., not just root). With DCAC, applications control their privileges with a mechanism implemented and enforced by the operating system, but without central coordination.</p><p>DCAC is particularly practical for distributed environments, e.g., where machines share a file system via NFS. In such an environment, applications simply use the file system to express access control policy, and any host that mounts the file system will enforce identical access control rules. DCAC does not add its own synchronization requirements, such as entries in a central database. Applications make all access control decisions with access only to their own files. In contrast, a centralized policy server might become a bottleneck when policy queries and updates are frequent, as in many server applications.</p><p>Application-defined principals: attributes. Attributes make applications simpler and more secure by allowing them to use access control implemented by the operating system rather than reimplementing their own. Traditional OS principals, such as users, are heavy-weight abstractions that cannot be directly used by applications e.g., a web application that manages its own users.</p><p>DCAC attributes are hierarchically named strings. Strings are separated into components by the "." character. The string .u.alice can represent the user Alice, but applications are free to define their own encodings and even their own principals. For example, the string .p.387.1357771171 might be a principal referring to a process with identifier 387 started about 1.4 billion seconds after January <ref type="bibr">1, 1970;</ref> .app.browser.password might be a component of a browser that is responsible for storing and retrieving the user's passwords. A process may carry multiple attributes simultaneously.</p><p>Practicality. DCAC combines ideas from mandatory access control (MAC) systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">16]</ref>, sandboxing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>, and decentralized information flow control (DIFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29]</ref> into a practical access control system that is fully backward compatible with current Linux. While MAC and DIFC systems can provide stronger guarantees than DCAC, they require far more effort to use and often struggle with backward compatibility. We believe that application developers will incrementally improve the security of their applications if presented with a simple security programming model that introduces a minimum of new concepts and that can implement security idioms common in modern web-connected applications.</p><p>The next section ( §2) provides motivating scenarios for DCAC, followed by an extended discussion of design ( §3) and relationship to Linux DAC ( §4). We describe our DCAC prototype ( §5), with a discussion of several applications we modified to use DCAC ( §6). We evaluate DCAC ( §7), discuss related work ( §8) and conclude ( §9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Modern access control idioms</head><p>We discuss three access control idioms common in today's web-connected applications that are difficult to achieve in modern systems: sandboxing, ad hoc sharing, and managing users. Because these idioms are not well served by current system security abstractions, applications constantly reimplement these idioms, and implement them poorly. Section 3.2 shows how DCAC supports them more naturally than current systems.</p><p>Ad hoc sharing. Existing systems provide limited facilities for sharing between users. Suppose Alice wishes to share a file or directory with Bob. She can directly send the relevant data to Bob, but if both users wish to be able to update the data they must manually communicate each change. She might change file or directory permissions to allow read/write access to a group that contains both Alice and Bob. Unless this specific group already exists, Alice must rely on a system administrator to create a new group containing both users. If she wishes to add or remove users, she must also rely on a superuser. <ref type="table">(File/IPC</ref>   If the need to share files expires, an administrator must clean up stale groups. Facilities such as POSIX ACLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref> allow users to create more expressive access control lists, by specifying multiple users and groups who may read and write a file. If Alice wishes to share with many users, however, she must either add each user to an ACL for each file to be shared, or again use a group whose membership may only be modified by the superuser. Users should be able to define new groups of users without administrator support, and use those groups in access control on their files.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Object</head><p>Managing users. Server applications often have access control requirements similar to those of operating systems, with multiple users having different privileges. However, such applications usually implement access control with manual checks in their own code. Custom security code is a common source of security bugs: a single missed access check can expose sensitive data to unprivileged users. However, most non-trivial applications leveraging OS access control for application security must execute as different OS-level principals and hence require superuser privilege. Such an application must reserve user or group identifiers for its use during installation and possibly during maintenance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Design</head><p>In DCAC, the OS enforces simple rules about hierarchical strings (called attributes) that are stored in OSmanaged process and file metadata. Applications define conventions for what attributes mean to them, allowing them to create access control abstractions that are enforced by the OS.</p><p>Hierarchical strings are a self-describing mechanism to express decentralized privilege, where any extension of an existing string represents a subset of the parent's privileges. DCAC attributes have components separated by a "." character: .u.alice is a parent attribute of .u.alice.photo. The hierarchy allows regular users to manage principals and policies without requiring a system administrator. For example, Alice may define a new principal for running her photo application (e.g., .u.alice.photo) because she owns and controls .u.alice.</p><p>Each process carries an attribute set, which is inherited across process control events such as fork() and exec(). A process also maintains a default ACL. Similar to Linux's umask, files created by the process have their access control lists set to the process' default ACL.</p><p>Each object (such as a file or shared memory segment) has an access control list containing rules that allow processes to access the object based on attributes in the processes' attribute sets. An access control list specifies four access modes: read, write, execute, and modify. Each mode has an attribute expression, and a process may access a file in a given mode if the process' attribute set satisfies the attribute expression for that access mode. For example, the read access mode might specify .u.alice ∨ .g.student which provides read access to user Alice and members of group student (see the read access mode of the object in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>Read, write and execute access modes represent the rwx permission bits in UNIX-like file systems. The modify mode specifies the permission to modify the file's access control list. In UNIX-like systems, the file's owner implicitly has the right to modify a file's access control.</p><p>In DCAC, each access mode has an attribute expression in disjunctive normal form (DNF) without negations. For example, a jpg file may have the following access modes: read = (.u.alice.photo) ∨ (.u.bob.photo) write = (.u.alice.photo ∧ .u.alice.edit) exec = ∅ modif y = (.u.alice) If a process has attribute set {u.bob.photo}, it can read this jpg file, but cannot write to it or modify its ACL.</p><p>Broadly, DCAC defines rules similar to existing discretionary access control (DAC) in Linux and other systems. A process' attribute set specifies the acting principal, similar to a process' UID and GID. A file's access control list specifies which principals may access the file, similar to permission bits, which in conjunction with a file's owner and group specify access rights for a UID and GID. However, DCAC is significantly more flexible and decentralized. A process can have many attributes in its attribute set without differentiating between users and groups, files can specify formulae for allowing processes access, and there is no central mapping between string identifiers understandable by the user and integers understandable by the system.</p><p>Note that although we use .u.񮽙user񮽙 and .g.񮽙group񮽙 throughout the paper to couch our discussion in terms of users and groups, DCAC does not enforce any attribute naming scheme. Users and groups in DCAC exist only by convention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Adding and dropping attributes</head><p>DCAC allows a process to change its access control state by modifying its attribute set. Attribute set modification allows users and applications to run different processes with different privileges. A process p can always drop an attribute from its attribute set, but to add an attribute, it must satisfy one of the following rules:</p><p>• p has the parent of the requested attribute (e.g. .u.alice is the parent of .u.alice.photo).</p><p>• p has permission to use an attribute gateway (discussed later in this section). A process can add attributes to its attribute set in one of two modes, read or modify, depending on its attribute set and the configuration of attribute gateways. Read mode enables a process to use an attribute. Modify mode adds control over granting the attribute to other processes. A process with an attribute in modify mode can always downgrade that attribute to read mode. A process cannot upgrade an attribute to modify mode without a gateway or a parent attribute in modify mode. When extending an attribute by adding a new component, the extended attribute has the same mode as the parent.</p><p>Allowing a process to create and add attributes based on hierarchy permits regular users to create new principals without requiring administrator privileges. To enable flexible, application-defined resource sharing, processes use attribute gateways to acquire attributes based on user-defined rules.</p><p>Decentralized policy via attribute gateways. A primary design goal for DCAC is decentralization. Instead of centralized credentials (e.g., /etc/group) or centralized access policy (e.g., SELinux's policy.conf), DCAC distributes credentials and access policy using attribute gateways, which are a new type of file (in our Linux implementation, they are empty regular files with specific extended attributes). An attribute gateway allows a process to add new attributes to its attribute set based on its current attribute set. An attribute gateway is a rights amplification mechanism, like a setuid binary, but more flexible.</p><p>An attribute gateway has only two access modes, read and modify (execute and write are not used). If a process' attributes fulfill an access mode for a gateway, then the process may add the attribute to its set in that mode. For example, Alice might tell her colleagues that she is starting a group with attribute .u.alice.g.atc for documents related to a submission to USENIX ATC. She sends email to the members of the group explaining that there is a gateway for the group in a file called˜alice called˜alice/groups/atc.gate. Her collaborators modify their login scripts to open that attribute gateway as part of their login process. The gateway's read access mode consists of a disjunction listing the user attributes for the group's members (e.g., read = (.u.alice)∨(.u.bob) . . .).</p><p>Gateways decentralize credentials and access policy. Multiple gateways (or no gateways) may exist for any attribute, with the location of the gateways and their access controlled by users and convention. DCAC does not force use of a central repository of credentials or access policy, though users may choose to create and use centralized repositories.</p><p>Having an attribute in modify mode allows a process to decide which other principals can obtain the attribute, just as having modify access to a file allows a process to control which principals can access the file. Specifically, having an attribute in modify mode allows a process to change the access control list for any gateway for the attribute, or to create new gateways for the attribute.</p><p>Access policies should incur performance penalties only for features they actually use <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>. With a hierarchical attribute namespace and decentralized attribute gateways, different users and applications can perform administration in their own domains without contention; in contrast, any administrative operations on UIDs and /etc/passwd (for example) require central coordination across the system.</p><p>Gateway management. Gateway management is up to users and their applications. Since DCAC is a generic kernel-level mechanism, it does not impose requirements for gateway locations; however, specific system deployments or applications can follow conventions such as a central repository of gateways. (Similarly, the Linux kernel does not enforce the use of the /etc/passwd file, making it general enough to support Android's application-based access control.) While users can harm themselves with incorrectly set gateway permissions, gateways do not add problems beyond those of current systems as there are already opportunities for self-harm with standard file permissions. For example, a user can make his or her ssh private key file world readable.</p><p>DCAC allows gateways to be in any location, which could result in a less regulated environment than in centralized systems. With current file permissions it is relatively easy (modulo perhaps setuid binaries) to determine exactly which users and groups may (transitively) access a file. Attribute gateways require an exhaustive search of the filesystem to find all attributes that might allow a given process access to a file. On the other hand, because it is easier to run processes with reduced privilege, a user could restrict her programs to only create gateways in specific, relevant directories.</p><p>Summary. We believe DCAC achieves a new balance of expressivity and simplicity due to the features:</p><p>• The attribute abstraction is generic. An attribute can represent a user, a group, a capability, an application or a category of files, depending on the user or the application's need.</p><p>• Attributes are hierarchically named, making privilege delegation possible by extending existing attributes.</p><p>• Decentralized attribute gateways allow processes to acquire attributes that they would otherwise not be able to acquire strictly from attribute hierarchy. Creation of and policy for gateways is controlled by users and applications.</p><p>• Attributes are self-explaining strings. There is no need to map attributes to other OS-level identifiers like UIDs. Identical strings from different machines refer to the same attribute, making attributes directly sharable. This enables DCAC to support NFS ( §6.3) with minimal development effort.</p><p>• There is no rigid distinction between "trusted" and "untrusted" processes. Instead, process access boundaries can be flexibly defined and flexibly delegated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">DCAC supports modern access control idioms</head><p>Here, we describe how DCAC supports the modern access control idioms described in §2.</p><p>Privilege separation/Sandboxing. Suppose Alice wishes to run her photo manager in a separate, restricted environment. Alice invokes her photo manager with a simple wrapper that does the following: 1. Adds a .u.alice.photo attribute (allowed because Alice's process runs with the .u.alice attribute). 2. Drops the .u.alice attribute. 3. Executes her photo application. She may similarly run her PDF reader in a separate, restricted environment by following the same steps with a .u.alice.pdf attribute. Alice then sets up ACLs to allow processes running with .u.alice.photo to access her photo manager's files, and .u.alice.pdf to access her pdf reader's files. Each application may now access only its own set of files. In §6.2, we show how DCAC helps to sandbox an application (Evince) with vulnerabilities.</p><p>A DCAC-aware application may also enable finer privilege separation between different components. Suppose Alice's photo application wishes to isolate its file decoding routines. It may run those routines in a separate process which carries the .u.alice.photo.reader attribute, and drops the .u.alice.photo attribute. The program can grant .u.alice.photo.reader read-only access to the photo files but nothing else, to prevent an exploit from reading other files or writing any file.</p><p>Ad hoc sharing. Hierarchical attributes combined with policies for adding attributes to a process' attribute set allow regular users to customize how they share files. Suppose that Alice (whose processes carry the .u.alice attribute) wishes to share a file or set of files with a group of users including Bob (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref> by locating the attribute gateway, and using it to add the attribute .u.alice.g.mygrp to their attribute set. These processes will be allowed the relevant access to any file with an ACL that matches .u.alice.g.mygrp. Alice can change membership of her group via ACLs on the attribute gateway. Note that the ad hoc group is a set of attributes; besides OS users, they may also represent any application-defined principals. Ad hoc sharing is used in our modified DokuWiki server in §6.1.</p><p>Managing users. Consider a server application that runs processes for multiple users, and stores user data in files. The server can use DCAC to implement access control by assigning different attributes to different users' processes, allowing application-level security requirements to be easily expressed as string attributes. For example, Linux user Alice runs myserver. A user on the server, webuser, is assigned an attribute set that has only .u.alice.myserver.u.webuser. A server process serving webuser's requests can only access files which allow access to .u.alice.myserver.u.webuser. If the processes need to share some common files, the server can add a common attribute .u.alice.myserver.common to their attribute sets, and add the attribute to the files' ACLs. Our modified DokuWiki server ( §6.1) manages user and group permissions this way.</p><p>If a server application executes on multiple machines, it only needs to synchronize on relevant policies under its management, instead of updating them for the whole system. Server applications do not need to synchronize on a map between application-level users and OS-level access control state.</p><p>We apply DCAC to NFS (see §6.3). While different machines still share a set of OS users and groups that are already under centralized management, applicationdefined principals and policies do not require centralization.</p><p>Sub-principals delegating to sub-principals. DCAC allows flexible delegation to sub-principles, addressing one of the most vexing problems created by many application-specific user management systems (such as sshd and apache).</p><p>Consider the following: Professor X and Professor Y wish to collaborate. Y sends a credential (like a public key) to X and X uses it to add Y as a sub-principal. Y can now access resources shared by X, such as a subversion repository holding a joint publication. However, Professor Y recruits graduate student Z to actually do the work. Most sub-principal systems are not flexible enough to allow Y to delegate to Z without giving Z his credential. Therefore, Y must talk to X and make him aware of Z. X's list is a centrally administered bottleneck.</p><p>DCAC allows principals in a service to define and manage their sub-principals, without registering them with the service in a centralized way. Using DCAC, Professor Y can provide Z a login without involving Professor X and without revealing his credential to Z.</p><p>We let a local user, X, have his own program, sub-auth, to authenticate his sub-users. The program is located at a known per-user location in the system, such as˜Xas˜X/subusers/sub-auth. X's sub-auth program can define where the credentials of his sub-users are stored, and how to authenticate sub-sub-users. For example, it may use a file to store sub-users' credentials, and delegate authentication to the sub-user. Thus, Y, a sub-user of X, would have his own sub-auth program to authenticate Y's sub-users. §6.4 shows a detailed example of delegation for sub-users using sshd.</p><p>DCAC does not require sub-auth programs, nor does it require particular naming conventions for them. A user may authenticate sub-users with a chain of certificates provided during login. A sub-user would require a certificate chain of length one: a local user vouching for the sub-user. A sub-sub-user must provide a chain of length two, and so on. Such a scheme does not require local storage for credentials and each user must only vouch for (and know about) their direct sub-users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Harmonious coexistence of DCAC and DAC</head><p>DCAC is designed to work harmoniously with Linux's existing discretionary access control system (DAC), but it has mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms to express policies more nuanced than what can be expressed by DAC alone. DCAC can augment a process' rights (e.g., allow Alice's calendar process to read a file Bob's process wrote and shared with Alice), but it can also restrict rights (e.g., limit Alice's photo reader from reading her email). If instead we required DAC and DCAC access checks to succeed, Alice would have to adjust permissions on many of her files to start using DCAC (e.g., she would have to make her authorized keys readable by sshd).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Restricting Linux DAC. Using DCAC for restricting</head><p>Linux DAC permissions requires two additional pieces of state, a pmask (permissions mask), and a UID-bit. Each process has a pmask and a UID-bit that are inherited by child processes after a fork(), and are maintained across exec(). A process can only change its pmask by making it more restrictive (i.e., by clearing bits), and it can only clear the UID-bit.</p><p>The permissions mask is intended to prevent a process from reading or writing resources that Linux's DAC permissions allow (e.g., because the UID of a process and file owner match, and the file owner has read access). The permissions mask is ANDed with standard DAC permissions bits before each permissions check. So a DCAC system will check (perms &amp; pmask) instead of perms. Therefore, pmask = 0777 does not restrict Linux DAC, while pmask = 0755 restricts write access to other users' files, and pmask = 0 causes all DAC permission checks to fail.</p><p>Each process has a UID-bit which is intended to limit the ambient authority granted to a process when its UID matches the UID of a resource. For example, currently in Linux, a process may change the permissions on a file or directory with matching UID even if it has no permissions on the file or its containing directory. If the UID-bit is clear, the process is restricted in the following ways: 1. It can only change the DAC permissions and DCAC ACLs of files with matching UID if it satisfies the modify access mode. 2. kill and ptrace are restricted to child processes. 3. It cannot remove an IPC object, change permissions on it, or lock/unlock a shared memory segment, unless the DCAC check for the object's modify access mode succeeds. A process with the UID-bit set may modify DAC permissions and ACLs for files and directories with matching UIDs. An unrestricted process (e.g., running as root) with the UID-bit set can change DAC permissions and DCAC ACLs on any file or directory. It can also can send signals to any process.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Programming interface</head><p>In DCAC, attributes are managed through file descriptors. When a process successfully adds an attribute, it receives a file descriptor for that attribute. The corresponding kernel file object is a wrapper for the attribute. We use system calls open, openat and close to add and drop attributes.</p><p>• int openat(int fd, char * suffix, int flags):</p><p>If fd represents an attribute attr in the attribute set, this call adds attr.񮽙suffix񮽙 and returns the associated file descriptor. flags can be O RDONLY, or O RDMOD, representing that the requested access mode is read or modify (which subsumes read). If the parent attribute has only read mode, requests for modify access mode on the new attribute will be denied.</p><p>• int open(char * pathname, flags):</p><p>If the file at pathname is an attribute gateway, DCAC will evaluate the access modes according to flags (O RDONLY or O RDMOD). On success, the attribute is added and the corresponding file descriptor is returned. Note that this operation does not open the actual gateway file.</p><p>• int close(int fd):</p><p>If fd represents an attribute, that attribute is dropped.</p><p>A potential issue with using file descriptors is compatibility with applications which are not aware of DCAC. Sometimes applications close all open file descriptors as a clean-up step (since file descriptors persist on fork and exec), which results in unintended dropping of attributes. To address this problem, we add a lock flag to each process' DCAC state. When the flag is set, the process' DCAC state cannot be changed, until the flag is cleared. One can set this flag in a wrapper and then invoke the application (see §6.2). The lock flag is intended solely to ease backward compatibility.</p><p>A related complication of using file descriptors to represent attributes is that programs may set the close onexec flag on their open file descriptors. For instance, if bash is started as a login shell (where it needs to load the user's custom settings), it sets the close on exec flag on all file descriptors except the standard I/O streams. This can causes attributes to be dropped unintentionally. DCAC ignores close on exec for attributes.</p><p>Besides open, openat, and close, all other operations are encoded into 4 new system calls. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref> shows the DCAC API.</p><p>We additionally wrote a 274-line 2 SWIG 3 wrapper to make DCAC functionality available in PHP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Processes and Objects</head><p>The core functionality of DCAC is implemented as a Linux security module (LSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref>).</p><p>Processes. LSMs use a security field in the Linux per kernel thread task struct structure to store the security context of a process. The DCAC state for a kernel thread includes the attribute set, default ACL, pmask and the UID-bit, all of which are stored in a structure pointed to by the security field (see §4).</p><p>In a multi-threaded application, each thread can have its own DCAC state. Threads can thus run on behalf of different principals, and access control decisions are based on their individual DCAC state, which would be useful for a trusted, uncompromised server application. However, running untrusted code in a thread can lead to loss of isolation between principals in case of a compromise as threads share the same address space.</p><p>Files. For persistent file systems, DCAC requires support for extended attributes. File permission (read, write, execute, and modify) ACLs are stored in files' extended attributes, with the entire ACL encoded in a single extended attribute. For attribute gateways, the attribute controlled by the gateway and its ACLs (read and modify) are encoded in a single extended attribute.</p><p>Permission checks happen only when files are opened and not on subsequent reads/writes. The permission check occurs in the inode permission LSM hook. The inode permission hook is a restrictive hook, which means it cannot grant access if a request is already denied by the Linux DAC. However, DCAC allows access if either DAC or DCAC is satisfied ( §4). Therefore, in addition to LSM, we modify 4 lines of code in fs/namei.c to achieve DCAC's semantics.</p><p>ACL cache. DCAC keeps a generic, in-memory ACL cache for each file in the VFS layer. There are two motivations for such a cache. First, it reduces performance overhead for remote file systems (e.g. NFS). Second, it makes DCAC usable for non-persistent file systems (e.g. sysfs). The in-memory inode structure contains an i security field, where DCAC stores the ACL cache. The cache is initialized (from the file's extended attributes) when the ACL is first needed: when a DAC permission check fails. The cache also records each file's change time (ctime) when the ACL is fetched. The cache provides a mechanism for file systems to invalidate ACL entries to enforce filesystem coherence semantics. The ctime value in each cache entry can be used to deter- Unlock the process' DCAC states. mine whether the entry needs to be invalidated, because changing the extended attribute causes a ctime change.</p><p>IPC objects. The Linux kernel's IPC object data structures share a common credential structure, kern ipcperm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28]</ref>, where the DCAC ACL is stored. DCAC checks permissions to access these objects in LSM multiple hooks. We changed 6 lines in ipc/utils.c to allow access if DAC or DCAC allows it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Attribute management</head><p>Using the rules described in §3.1, a process can only add new attributes based on existing attributes in its attribute set. To initialize attribute state, our Linux DCAC implementation allows processes running as root to add any attribute to their attribute sets with arbitrary modes (read or modify). We then modify system binaries, such as login, to initialize the attribute state for user processes. login is already responsible for initializing a process' UID and GID state by reading the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files and invoking system calls such as setuid and setgroups. We extend this responsibility to include attributes. Our examples use .u.alice to represent an attribute corresponding to a specific Linux user. We encode this convention in our prototype by changing login to add the .u.񮽙username񮽙 attribute, with both read and modify access modes, to user login shells. Similarly, .g.񮽙grpname񮽙 attributes represent Linux groups, and they are added with only read mode, since only root has administrative control of them. Modifying login required a 28 line change to the shadow 4.1.5.1 package.</p><p>We also modify sshd and the LightDM desktop manager <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">4</ref> to set up the attribute state when the user logs in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">4</ref> http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LightDM remotely or via a graphical user interface. We changed 37 lines of code in OpenSSH 5.9 and 20 lines of code in LightDM 1.2.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">DCAC application implementation</head><p>We demonstrate several use cases of DCAC in real applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Application-defined permissions in DokuWiki</head><p>DokuWiki 5 is a wiki written in PHP that stores individual pages as separate files in the filesystem. As a result, OS file-level permissions suffice for wiki access control. In fact, access control only requires setting attributes and default file ACLs on login. Then the OS ensures that all ACL checks occur properly, without need for application-level logic.</p><p>We add a 246-line DCAC module to DokuWiki's collection of authentication modules. DokuWiki with DCAC executes in a webserver initialized with the .apps.dokuwiki attribute. Upon user login, the webserver process acquires a user-specific attribute .apps-.dokuwiki.u.񮽙username񮽙 and drops .apps.dokuwiki. Default ACLs on all created files are set to the userspecific attribute. The server permits anonymous page creation and access through a common attribute .apps-.dokuwiki.common. DokuWiki runs as a CGI script to ensure a new process with the .apps.dokuwiki attribute handles each request, restricting the impact of a compromise during a request to the logged in user. Otherwise, a reused compromised process could affect other users when it acquires their attributes during a new request.</p><p>DokuWiki has a built-in ACL system that is only controllable by superusers. We modify DokuWiki to support user-created groups. To do this, we create a new directory to hold gateway files with a directory per wiki user. When a user creates a group, she also creates a gateway file to attribute .apps.dokuwiki-.u.񮽙username񮽙.g.񮽙groupname񮽙 with the name of the group in a per-user location defined by a DokuWiki naming convention. The gateway file has read permission for the members of the group. Each user's group directory is traversable (has execute permission) by all users. When a user is informed (out of band) that she has been added to a new group, she records the group name and gateway path name in her groups file. We have a user modify her own groups file to ensure that her groups are not disclosed by arbitrary access to a common file. During login, the DCAC authentication module reads the user's groups file and attempts to access gateways and add group attributes.</p><p>We add calls to DokuWiki's XML RPC interface to use this group functionality: setPerms(pageName, perms) allows the DCAC permissions of wiki files to be adjusted. setGroup(groupName, members) modifies the membership of the group named groupName. Finally, getMyGroups and setMyGroups allow a user to activate the additional privileges given to her by groups by modifying her groups file.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Sandboxing Evince</head><p>We implement an application wrapper that sets up DCAC state for an application such as the default ACL, UID-bit, pmask and attribute set. The wrapper can perform userspecified work (via scripts) before application execution (e.g., granting a sandboxed application permissions to a specific file) and after application termination. With a wrapper, DCAC can sandbox unmodified applications because DCAC state is inherited across fork and exec.</p><p>We port a simple stack-based buffer overflow targeting an old version of Evince (evince-0.6.1) to test the sandboxing ability of DCAC. Since document viewers generally do not need write permission, we can sandbox Evince by clearing its UID-bit and setting its pmask = 0115, by using the application wrapper. We allow execute permission for directory traversal, and allow read for world-readable files so Evince can load its shared libraries. Additionally, to allow evince to open the target pdf file, the wrapper keeps .u.alice.evince in the attribute set, and adds it to the pdf file's ACL. The wrapper can reset the file's ACL after Evince terminates. Upon triggering the exploit, the attacker only has access to world readable files, and even a shell opened via an exploit remains confined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">NFS</head><p>In a normal NFS environment, machines are within the same trust domain, and share a common set of OS users and groups, which usually requires centralized management. By adopting an attribute naming convention for users and groups (such as .u.񮽙username񮽙 and .g.񮽙grpname񮽙), DCAC eliminates centralized management. A user can define her own sub-principals and manage them in her own way, on all machines.</p><p>The Linux NFS implementation does not support extended attributes, but we ported a patch for NFSv3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref> to add extended attribute support. In addition to the patch, we also modified 326 lines of code for NFS in the Linux kernel source.</p><p>The NFSv3 specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> does not define how a server should check permissions. In the NFS implementation in Linux, a client OS checks permissions when a file is opened, but the server does not check permission for subsequent read calls, or for write calls on the files that belong to the process' user. It only checks permission for write calls on files that belong to a different user. We remove this extra check in DCAC. We believe that this change is sensible, since under this change NFS files still obey the standard UNIX convention where permissions are checked only on open.</p><p>Clients must make DCAC access control decisions, as they have access to a process' attributes as well as the resource's (e.g., file's) attributes. However, creating or removing files and directories requires write access to the parent directory and in Linux NFS the client simply forwards these operations to the server without checking permissions. In DCAC, if a client uses attributes to determine that a create or remove operation is legal, it appends a hash of the cached ACL for the parent directory in its RPC to the server. The server checks the hash against the ACL, and if they match, it knows the client has an up-to-date copy and can trust the client's decision to allow the operation. While NFS servers trust their clients, this check is to ensure that clients do not make wrong decisions based on stale permissions. In addition, DCAC appends the process' default ACL to create and mkdir calls, to initialize ACLs on newly created files and directories.</p><p>For regular files, DCAC also uses the ACL cache to determine permission when they are opened. To guarantee close-to-open consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>, the cache is invalidated when a ctime change is observed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Managing sub-users in SSHD</head><p>We modify 81 lines of sshd to support the access control model described in Section 3.2.</p><p>Modern versions of sshd support a forced command option, which allows unprivileged users to authenticate sub-principals with public keys via the svnserve program. Arguments to svnserve control details like the user name for sub-principals (because sub-principals do not have user names in /etc/passwd). However, svnserve does not allow the kind of flexible delegation described in the next example.</p><p>Authentication example. When sshd receives a login request for X.Y, it invokes X's sub-auth program with only X's privilege, and passes to it the sub-user name "Y" and the credentials the request provides. If the sub-auth program returns successfully, sshd approves this request and restricts X.Y's privilege by properly setting the attribute set, pmask and UID-bit.</p><p>For a more concrete example, consider a hierarchy of users: X.Y.Z, described here and illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 3.</ref> 1. When X.Y.Z tries to login using ssh, he provides username "X.Y.Z" and some credential.</p><p>2. sshd invokes X's sub-auth program, passing subusername "Y.Z" and the credential to it, with UID set to X's and only .u.X in the attribute set.</p><p>(a) X's sub-auth finds that it is one-level down, it keeps only .u.X.Y in the attribute set, and restricts pmask and UID-bit. (b) It exec's Y's sub-auth, passing sub-username "Z" and the credential to it. Y's sub-auth verifies the credential, and returns successfully.</p><p>3. Now sshd knows the request is authenticated. Before exec'ing the shell, sshd keeps only .u.X.Y.Z in the attribute set, and restricts pmask and UID-bit.</p><p>Note that another OS user, A, can have a completely different sub-auth program. His sub-auth program may be based on certificate chains, and does not need further lower-layer sub-auth programs. For example, A can sign a certificate for B's public key as A.B, and B can sign another certificate for C's public key as A.B.C. When A.B.C logs in, he needs to provide the two certificates to be verified by A's sub-auth, as well as a proof that he has C's private key, such as a signature.</p></div>

On local ext4, the overhead is 1% to 4% for a 32B ACL, and 2% to 9% for a 256B ACL. On NFS, the overhead is below 5%. On ext4, the kernel stores extended attributes within inodes if they are below a certain size threshold. With 256-byte inodes, 32 bytes is below this threshold; 256 bytes is not, so extra disk blocks must be allocated, resulting in larger overhead in the mkdir and copy phases, where new files are created. For the du phase and the grep and sum phase, observed differences correspond to whether read ACLs are being checked and differ little for ACL sizes. This is likely because DCAC reads ACLs from ACL caches for most of the time.</p><p>On NFS, the number of round trips per operation dominates the performance; overhead for disk storage for extended attributes on the server is negligible in comparison. Most of the time, DCAC reads ACLs from the ACL caches, which does not incur network communication.</p><p>On the creation of a file or directory, DCAC appends the initial ACL to the create or mkdir RPC, instead of using a separate setxattr RPC.

DAC and DCAC check permission for shared memory segments and named pipes only when they are attached to the process' address space or opened; however, every up or down operation on a System V semaphore requires a permission check. We measure the overhead induced on semaphore operations by DCAC ACL checks. The baseline comes from the DCAC kernel   <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Kernel compile time, averaged over 5 trials.

The DCAC measurement comes from removing a process's DAC permissions by setting its pmask to 0 and giving it an attribute. The semaphore is accessible to processes with this attribute. Thus, we ensured that a DCAC ACL check is performed on every semaphore operation. We measure the average time per semaphore operation over a long sequence that alternated between up and down (measuring the average overhead of both), and set the initial semaphore value so that no semaphore opertion blocks. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref> shows 27% slowdown for a semaphore operation requiring a DCAC permission check.</p></div>

Capsicum shows that programmers want and will use system abstractions that make writing secure code easier. Capsicum implements a fairly standard capability model for security; its innovation is in casting file descriptors, an abstraction familiar to Unix programmers, as a capability. DCAC applies this insight by representing attributes as file descriptors. Capsicum's capability mode is similar to DCAC's pmask and DCAC's UID-bit, in that they are both used to deprivilege a process and restrain its ambient authority granted by legacy access control systems; however, DCAC's pmask and UID-bit are more fine-grainedthey can selectively restrict a process' ability to perform different operations on different files.</p><p>UserFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref> leverages existing OS protection mechanisms to increase application security by explicitly maintaining a hierarchy of UIDs to represent principals.

A key contribution of DCAC is that it combines the models used by users (file access control and sharing) and administrators (creating sandboxes).</p><p>Capsicum has a daemon, Casper, which provides services to sandboxed processes; in DarpaBrowser <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>, confined code can access resources in the system via Powerboxes, which is controlled by user interface interactions. These techniques are also applicable to DCAC, providing confined processes an alternative path to reach privileged resources without escalation.</p><p>Flexible policy specification. <ref type="bibr">SELinux [16]</ref> and AppArmor <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref> aim to provide comprehensive policies for the resources that applications can access. This comprehensiveness can lead to usability problems: SELinux is notoriously difficult to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>. Both of them are only manageable by administrators and have difficulty accommodating situations where policies for one application vary per user. DCAC is configurable on a per-user basis.</p><p>eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XA-CML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref> is an XML-based format for defining access control. While flexible, it relies on XML manipulations (e.g., XPath queries) that are unsuited for use in frequent latency-sensitive operations within an OS.</p><p>POSIX ACLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref> allow for users to define expressive access control lists for permissions. However, these have important limitations, like the inability to support userdefined groups without explicitly putting all group members in the ACL of every file that has group permission (which in turn makes group membership updates difficult). DCAC can accommodate user-defined groups.</p><p>The Andrew File System <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref> (AFS) supports flexible, per-directory ACLs, and allows users to create groups under their own administration. In comparison, DCAC is not restricted to a specific file system or IPC mechanism, and supports more general usage due to its attributebased model. Application-and user-defined access control. Several prior systems allow program-controlled subdivision of users into further users for finer-grained protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">23]</ref>. These systems still label processes by one user, and as a result are less flexible than DCAC. Ad-ditionally, these systems do not store information about the user hierarchy in a way that easily allows shared use in a network filesystem: UserFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref> requires synchronization of unrelated applications on a global database of all users. By contrast, DCAC attributes are strings that self-describe where they belong in the attribute hierarchy.</p><p>DCAC is inspired by attribute-based access control, proposed as part of InkTag <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>. DCAC generalizes the approach to a trusted OS and makes it coexist with existing access control.</p><p>New security models. Decentralized Information Flow Control (DIFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29]</ref> systems modify access privileges based on the information that applications have accessed. DIFC-enforcing systems may provide stronger security guarantees than DCAC.</p><p>Systems that use radically different security models require that developers adapt the logic of their code to work in these models. While DCAC may require code changes to applications, we expect they will be less significant because DCAC's core concept, the attribute, is implemented as a file descriptor, and is easily mapped onto users and groups, concepts that are familiar to developers and likely reflected in their code. Enforcing new security models can require extensive global OS modification, whereas DCAC's changes fit mostly within the existing LSM framework.</p></div>

updating each file every time she wants to share with a 
new user, like Bob, Alice instead does the following: 
1. She creates a new attribute .u.alice.g.mygrp. 
2. Alice creates a new attribute gateway for .u.alice.g.-
mygrp (e.g., ˜alice/groups/mygrp.gate) and 
sets its attribute formula for the read access mode to
