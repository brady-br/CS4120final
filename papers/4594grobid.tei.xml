				<p>Online privacy and security notices are rather ineffective: Very few people read them, and those who do find them difficult to understand and remember. How can we create privacy and security notices that are inviting, engaging, com-prehensible, and memorable, even for users with dyslexia or a lower literacy level? In this paper, we propose to investigate the use of comics for privacy and security notices. We describe the ongoing development of comic notices for the &quot;transparency and choice&quot; part of Google&apos;s privacy policy, as well as a research plan to test these notices against existing notices in various different settings.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Although "transparency" is often cited as an important prerequisite for making accurate privacy and security decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>, in reality, the privacy implications of using online services are hidden in lengthy "End-User License Agreements". These agreements are often read by less than 1% of all users <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and their linguistic complexity is often far beyond the capabilities of average users <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. For example, the Google+ privacy policy has a Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score 1 of 51.61 (below the recommended 60-70), while Facebook's privacy policy has a score of only 15.0. Similarly, Google's "Safe Browsing diagnostic page", a crucial tool in deciding whether to adhere to or ignore a malware warning in Google Chrome, has been found "confusing and unsatisfying" <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Several researchers have attempted to simplify privacy notices, e.g. using "nutrition labels" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, standardized language <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, textured agreements <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and summary reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. While some of these methods increase searchability and are more inviting for users to read, these improvements do not necessarily lead to better comprehension of the actual policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Moreover, even the most prominent characteristics of agreements are usually forgotten within a few seconds after reading them <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. According <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> See http://read-able.com/ Copyright is held by the author/owner. Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee. Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) 2016, June <ref type="bibr">22-24, 2016, Denver, Colorado.</ref> to Nissenbaum <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, these problems are due to the "transparency paradox": a privacy notice that is simple enough to understand usually oversimplifies the privacy situation it tries to explain; a notice that faithfully describes the situation, on the other hand, is usually too complex, too dull, and too lengthy for people to read.</p><p>For large consumer IT firms, these problems are even further exacerbated for three reasons: First of all, they offer not a single product but a suite of products-both software and hardware-that share a single user profile. The exact privacy policy thus depends on the combination of products that a user is using, and changes every time the user adopts a new product. Second, IT firms serve an evergrowing global market of users, and new entrants often have a lower level of literacy. In fact, about 40% of all Internet users are estimated to have "very low" to "low" levels of literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>. Third, Internet usage is shifting towards mobile devices, which further reduce both the amount of attention paid to and the readability of large complex texts.</p><p>Given the widespread user ignorance towards privacy and security notices, the growing gap between their readability and users' literacy level, and the low comprehension and retention of those who actually read the notices, it is clear that we need to radically rethink privacy and security notices, lest we fail on the "informed" part of "informed consent" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. How can we create privacy and security notices that are inviting, engaging, comprehensible, and memorable for anyone? In this paper, we propose to investigate the use of comics for privacy and security notices. We describe the ongoing development of comic notices for the "transparency and choice" part of Google's privacy policy, as well as a research plan to test these notices against existing notices in various different settings. Specifically, we will conduct an interview study to decide on the comic format, a controlled experiment to test comprehension and retention, a field trial to test engagement and practical use, and an additional field trial to test the effectiveness of the comics for lower-literacy users. Following a brief introduction to the idea of using comics for privacy and security notices, we will describe the interview study and the controlled experiment in some detail, and then proceed to briefly discuss our future activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">COMICS AS PRIVACY NOTICES</head><p>Comic books are among the most compelling forms of print media, a quality that has led language education scholars to suggest that they be used to increase literacy among beginning readers and second-language students <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. They are also used to provide health education and patient care to young people, non-native speakers, and people with low literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Comics are inherently textured, i.e., they convey high-level information via their page layout and mise en sc√®ne elements on each panel, which allow readers to understand the general "storyline", and be directed to the more detailed information that is encapsulated in each panel <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. This quality is useful for license agreements, which have been shown to benefit from a textured layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Although previous work on privacy notices has used illustrations to support the text <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, in comic books the text invariably supports the illustrations. This makes them particularly appropriate for people with lower literacy levels and/or a visual learning style <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>. Finally, while the visual aspects of comics are captivating (which may increase the frequency and extent to which the notice is actually read), the static, serial presentation requires readers to actively engage with the content (which may increase comprehension and retention of the presented information) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>. This sets comics apart from regular text (which requires engagement but is not captivating) and video (which is captivating but does not require engagement).</p><p>Comic-based privacy and security notices have two additional advantages in the increasingly frequent scenario where an IT firm provides a "product suite" of multiple applications to the user, tied together with a single user profile. First of all, individual comics are often part of a series: they present a story within the context of an overarching narrative. This quality may make it easier to present the interrelated privacy consequences of using several products that share a single user profile. Second, comics have a variable lengththey exist as single panels, multi-panel strips, page-length stories, or an entire book. This allows them to be used for notices with different levels of complexity, while still keeping a unified narrative style and presentation across notices. For example, within the Google ecosystem comics of different lengths could be used for the following purposes: a single panel or strip for simple notices (e.g. Android app permissions, cookie consent notices, safe browsing diagnostics), a page for moderately complex notices (e.g. privacy statements, license agreements), and a multi-page story for complex notices (e.g. the Google Safety Center).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">PRELIMINARY COMICS</head><p>For our initial research, we consider the "transparency and choice" part of Google's privacy policy 2 . This section of Google's privacy policy explains how users can gain insight into the information Google collects about them, and make choices about how this information is used. The section refers to seven pages that can be used for this purpose. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref> shows the verbatim text.</p><p>The bullet point descriptions of the seven pages are rather short-this is understandable, because they are tailored to users' limited attention span. A predicted advantage of our comics, however, is that they will captivate users' attention long enough to allow expanding the length of these descriptions. Aside from these short descriptions, we therefore also develop a medium and long description for each page:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The short descriptions are verbatim versions of the bullets in Google's "transparency and choice" text. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 2</ref> shows the comic version of the short description of the Activity Controls page (the first bullet point).</p><p>‚Ä¢ The medium descriptions are slightly longer versions of the short descriptions. Specifically, we added one or two sentences describing situation in which a user would like to access the page. Moreover, we slightly paraphrased the descriptions to sound more like colloquial narratives than bullet point items.  shows the comic version of the medium description of the Activity Controls page. The text version consists of a concatenation of the text at the top of each panel.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The long descriptions expand upon the medium versions. Specifically, they describe in more detail the situation in which a user would like to access the page, linking it to higher-level user goals (i.e., mentioning why user may find themselves in need to access the page). Moreover, we expand the number of examples of the different aspects and features on the described page. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the comic version of the long description of the Activity Controls page. The text version consists of a concatenation of the text at the top of each panel.</p><p>For each type of description-short, medium, and long-we develop a text version (just the description) and a comic version (the description incorporated into a comic strip). The short descriptions are illustrated with short (mostly single panel) comics; the medium and long comics contain more panels (4-6 and 8-12, respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">RESEARCH PLAN</head><p>With our research we expect to gain insight into the effectiveness of comics as a medium for privacy and security notices. In our initial research plan, we therefore compare the comic-based notices against the text-based notices in various settings. These studies are described in this section. Once we have established the effectiveness of our comics, we will further optimize their parameters (e.g. drawing styles, use of color, type of content, presence of text, number of panels, narrative flow) to make them even more effective. We briefly discuss this effort in the future work section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Interview Study</head><p>Our first planned study is an interview study to gain deeper insight into the feelings evoked by our comics. This study we will also give us qualitative feedback about the clarity and appeal of our comics. We will use this feedback to iterate on our comic designs.</p><p>We plan to recruit 30-50 local participants for the interview study. Participants will be asked to comment on a ran- domly chosen description for each page. We will ask them to rephrase the description in their own words (to test comprehension), their privacy expectations based on the description, and their evaluation of the quality of the description. We will subsequently show them the page associated with the description, and ask them if this page aligns with their expectations based on the description. Finally, we will show them an alternative description, and ask them to compare this version against the original description they were shown. All questions are listed in Appendix A.1.</p><p>Users' feedback will give us a preliminary understanding about whether the comic-based privacy notices are useful, and which description length is most ideal. Users' critique of the individual descriptions will be used to redesign them for future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Controlled Experiment</head><p>The second planned study is an online controlled experiment, to be conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk with at least 180 participants. The experiment is a 3x2 betweensubjects experiment (3 description lengths: short, medium, long; 2 description types: text, comic). Participants will be told that they are participating in a usability study of Google's product settings. They will then be asked to read the description (matching their randomly assigned experimental condition) of the first page. Their reading time will be recorded to gauge their level of engagement with the description.</p><p>Participants will then move to a prototype of the page itself to set their settings as they would on their real Google account <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . By observing their actions, we can measure to what extent the description motivated them to change the default settings (something users are not particularly prone to do <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>). Next, participants are given a short multiple choice test that tests users' comprehension of the page they just saw. Example questions for the Activity Controls page are listed in Appendix A.2. It is our hypothesis that if the explanation was successful, participants are more effective at exploring the page, and thus also better at answering these questions. This sequence (description, page, test) will repeat itself for all seven pages.</p><p>Once all seven pages have been covered, the participants will receive a final multiple choice test that will test their understanding of the purpose of each of the seven pages. The questions in this "Overview Test" are listed in Appendix A.3. Finally, participants will be asked to evaluate the quality of the descriptions, the settings interface, users' privacy threat, and their general privacy and collection concerns. These questionnaires are listed in Appendix A.4.</p><p>Two to four weeks after the experiment, the participants will be invited to participate again. This time, they will first complete the Overview Test, and then each of the seven pages followed by their Comprehension Test.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to test the combined effect of description length (short, medium, long) and type (text, comic) on participants' comprehension, engagement, and decision behavior. The follow-up study will test their retention of the material. Based on the results of the study, we can find the strengths and weaknesses of having a comic-based description over a standard description of various lengths. Our hypothesis is that longer descriptions will be more informative and thus effective, but only when presented in comic format, because that is the only way to engage users for a sufficient amount of time to read the entire description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Field Trial</head><p>Our third planned study is a field trial of the comic descriptions. This trial will run in a classroom setting, where students will use Google services as part of the course activities. In this trail, the comic description of the most optimal length (as observed in the controlled experiment) is again tested against its text-only counterpart. Participants will receive the descriptions in weekly emails, and the descriptions will link to the actual Google settings pages. During the trial, we will instrument participants' browsers with a tool that tracks the changes users make to their settings.</p><p>Besides the main manipulation of description type (text versus comic), the trial also tests the effects of "progressive disclosure": half of the participants will receive all seven descriptions in their email every week, while the other half will receive them one by one. Our hypothesis is that participants may be overwhelmed by the descriptions unless they are disclosed one by one; the latter condition will thus result in a higher level of engagement with the settings pages. Again, we expect that the comic-based descriptions will also lead to higher levels of engagement than the text-based descriptions. At the end of the field trail, participants will do the Overview Test (A.3), and fill out the questionnaires listed in Appendix A.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Trial with Low Literacy Users</head><p>Our final planned study is another field trial, but with low literacy users. This trial will be similar to the regular field trial. However, the overview test and the evaluation of the experience will be conducted in person, so as to avoid issues with understanding the questions due to participants' limited literacy levels. The in-person evaluation will also allow us to ask qualitative questions about users' experience with the descriptions and the settings pages, which will again provide valuable insights to further improve the descriptions specifically for low literacy users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">FUTURE WORK</head><p>The results of the controlled experiment described in this paper will tell us whether comics are an effective medium for privacy and security notices of various lengths. After confirming these results in realistic field trials with high literate and low literate users, we will turn to the task of optimizing the parameters of the comics to further improve their effectiveness and appeal. Specifically, we will investigate the following aspects:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Drawing style: Comic drawing styles range from simple line art to hyper-realistic. The choice of drawing style arguably involves a tradeoff between understandability and appeal, and the optimal drawing style may be user-dependent.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Use of color: While color comics may be more attractive, we would like to test whether high-contrast black-and-white comics are equally effective and appealing in an attempt to improve legibility on lowcontrast screens and for color-blind users.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Type of content: Our current comics display a mixture of people performing actions, stylized screenshots, and highlights. We would like to test the relative effectiveness and appeal of each of these types of content.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Text banners and speech bubbles: Comic artists use text banners and speech bubbles can be used to blend regular text with graphical elements. Which of these methods is most appealing and effective? Is it possible to represent privacy and security notices using "mute" comics without using any text? The latter would arguably be an improvement for low literacy users, and it would also avoid the need to translate the notice into many different languages.</p><p>‚Ä¢ number and size of panels: A comic may consist of few or many panels, irrespective of the length of the notice itself. Some comics also break up single panels into smaller components to provide additional structure to the reader. We would like to test the optimal number and size of panels for notices of various lengths.</p><p>‚Ä¢ narrative flow: Traditional comics have a left-toright, panel-by-panel narrative flow, but some comics break this structure using sub-panels and/or alternative layouts. We would like to test whether such alternative layouts are suitable for privacy and security notices.</p><p>Aside from testing the characteristics of the comics, we are also interested in testing a more holistic use of comics to explain a multitude of services (not just their privacy implications) from a single provider. We hypothesize that the comic design language can be used to create a narrative thread that allows users to gain an integrated understanding of the provided services, both in terms of their individual characteristics (e.g. "use Hangouts to communicate", "use Google Docs to write documents together") as well as their complementary qualities (e.g. "use Hangouts within Google Docs to discuss the document you are writing"). Branching comics (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) could be used to personalize such comics to the specific set of services that the user is using.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper we propose the use of comics as a medium for privacy and security notices. We hypothesize that comics can make such notices inviting, engaging, comprehensible, and memorable for anyone-even people with dyslexia or lower levels of literacy. We propose a series of planned studies that we will use to test these hypotheses, as well as a number of future studies that we will employ to further improve the effectiveness of these comic-based notices. We believe that the increased accessibility of such notices addresses the needs of an increasing number of low literacy Internet users, and we may even be able to make learning about privacy a fun and engaging activity... oh, what a wonderful world that would be! </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The "transparency and choice" section of Google's privacy policy.</figDesc></figure>
