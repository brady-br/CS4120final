			<abstract>
				<p>Modern society is increasingly surrounded by, and is growing accustomed to, a wide range of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), and smart devices. They often perform safety-critical functions, e.g., personal medical devices, automotive CPS as well as industrial and residential automation , e.g., sensor-alarm combinations. On the lower end of the scale, these devices are small, cheap and specialized sensors and/or actuators. They tend to host small anemic CPUs, have small amounts of memory and run simple software. If such devices are left unprotected, consequences of forged sensor readings or ignored actuation commands can be catastrophic, particularly, in safety-critical settings. This prompts the following three questions: (1) How to trust data produced, or verify that commands were performed, by a simple remote embedded device?, (2) How to bind these actions/results to the execution of expected software? and, (3) Can (1) and (2) be attained even if all software on a device can be modified and/or compromised? In this paper we answer these questions by designing, demonstrating security of, and formally verifying, APEX: an Architecture for Provable Execution. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first of its kind result for low-end embedded systems. Our work has a range of applications, especially, authenticated sensing and trustworthy actuation, which are increasingly relevant in the context of safety-critical systems. APEX is publicly available and our evaluation shows that it incurs low overhead, affordable even for very low-end embedded devices, e.g., those based on TI MSP430 or AVR ATmega processors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The number and diversity of special-purpose computing devices has been increasing dramatically. This includes all kinds of embedded devices, cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) gadgets, utilized in various "smart" or instrumented settings, such as homes, offices, factories, automotive systems and public venues. Tasks performed by these devices are often safety-critical. For example, a typical industrial control system depends on physical measurements (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, speed) reported by sensors, and on actions taken by actuators, such as: turning on the A/C, sounding an alarm, or reducing speed.</p><p>A cyber-physical control system is usually composed of multiple sensors and actuators, at the core of each is a low-cost micro-controller unit (MCU). Such devices typically run simple software, often on "bare metal", i.e., with no microkernel or hypervisor. They tend to be operated by a remote central control unit and despite their potential importance to overall system functionality, low-end devices are typically designed to minimize cost, physical size and energy consumption, e.g., TI MSP430.</p><p>Therefore, their architectural security is usually primitive or non-existent, thus making them vulnerable to malware infestations and other malicious software modifications. A compromised MCU can spoof sensed quantities or ignore actuation commands, leading to potentially catastrophic results. For example, in a smart city, large-scale erroneous reports of electricity consumption by smart meters might lead to power outages. A medical device that returns incorrect values when queried by a remote physician might result in a wrong drug being prescribed to a patient. A compromised car engine temperature sensor that reports incorrect (low) readings can lead to undetected overheating and major damage. However, despite very real risks of remote software compromise, most users believe that these devices execute expected software and thus perform their expected function.</p><p>In this paper, we argue that Proofs of Execution (PoX) are both important and necessary for securing low-end MCUs. Specifically, we demonstrate in Section 7.3, that PoX schemes can be used to construct sensors and actuators that "can not lie", even under the assumption of full software compromise. In a nutshell, a PoX conveys that an untrusted remote (and possibly compromised) device really executed specific software, and all execution results are authenticated and cryptographically bound to this execution. This functionality is similar to authenticated outputs that can be produced by software execution in SGX-alike architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr">25]</ref> on high-end devices, such as desktops and servers.</p><p>One key building block in designing PoX schemes is Remote Attestation (RA). Basically, RA is a means to detect malware on a remote low-end MCU. It allows a trusted verifier (V rf) to remotely measure memory contents (or software state) of an untrusted embedded device (P rv). RA is usually realized as a 2-message challenge-response protocol:</p><p>1. V rf sends an attestation request containing a challenge (C hal) to P rv. It might also contain a token derived from a secret (shared by V rf and P rv) that allows P rv to authenticate V rf. 2. P rv receives the attestation request, authenticates the token (if present) and computes an authenticated integrity check over its memory and C hal. The memory region can be either pre-defined, or explicitly specified in the request.</p><p>3. P rv returns the result to V rf. 4. V rf receives the result, and decides whether it corresponds to a valid memory state. The authenticated integrity check is typically implemented as a Message Authentication Code (MAC) computed over P rv memory. We discuss one concrete RA architecture in Section 3.</p><p>Despite major progress and many proposed RA architectures with different assumptions and guarantees <ref type="bibr">[6-8, 15, 19, 20, 29, 33, 35, 36, 39]</ref>, RA alone is insufficient to obtain proofs of execution. RA allows V rf to check integrity of software residing in the attested memory region on P rv. However, by itself, RA offers no guarantee that the attested software is ever executed or that any such execution completes successfully. Even if the attested software is executed, there is no guarantee that it has not been modified (e.g., by malware residing elsewhere in memory) during the time between its execution and its attestation. This phenomenon is well known as the Time-OfCheck-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) problem. Finally, RA does not guarantee authenticity and integrity of any output produced by the execution of the attested software.</p><p>To bridge this gap, we design and implement APEX: an Architecture for Provable Execution. In addition to RA, APEX allows V rf to request an unforgeable proof that the attested software executed successfully and (optionally) produced certain authenticated output. These guarantees hold even in case of full software compromise on P rv. Contributions of this work include: -New security service: we design and implement APEX for unforgeable remote proofs of execution (PoX). APEX is composed with VRASED <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, a formally verified hybrid RA architecture. As discussed in the rest of this paper, obtaining provably secure PoX requires significant architectural support on top of a secure RA functionality (see Section 7). Nonetheless, we show that, by careful design, APEX achieves all necessary properties of secure PoX with fairly low overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first security architecture for proofs of remote software execution on low-end devices. -Provable security &amp; implementation verification: secure PoX involves considering, and reasoning about, several details which can be easily overlooked. Ensuring that all necessary PoX components are correctly implemented, composed, and integrated with the underlying RA functionality is not trivial. In particular, early RA architectures oversimplified PoX requirements, leading to the incorrect conclusion that PoX can be obtained directly from RA; see examples in Section 2. In this work, we show that APEX yields a secure PoX architecture. All security properties expected from APEX implementation are formally specified using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and APEX modules are verified to adhere to these properties. We also prove that the composition of APEX new modules with a formally verified RA architecture (VRASED) implies a concrete definition of PoX security. -Evaluation, publicly available implementation and applications: APEX was implemented on a real-world low-end MCU (TI MSP430) and deployed using commodity FPGAs. Both design and verification are publicly available at <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Our evaluation shows low hardware overhead, affordable even for low-end MCUs. The implementation is accompanied by a sample PoX application; see Section 7.3. As a proof of concept, we use APEX to construct a trustworthy safety-critical device, whereupon malware can not spoof execution results (e.g., fake sensed values) without detection.</p><p>Targeted Devices &amp; Scope: This work focuses on CPS/IoT sensors and actuators with relatively weak computing power. They are some of the lowest-end devices based on low-power single core MCUs with only a few KBytes of program and data memory. Two prominent examples are: TI MSP430 and Atmel AVR ATmega. These are 8-and 16-bit CPUs, typically running at 1-16MHz clock frequencies, with ≈ 64 KBytes of addressable memory. SRAM is used as data memory and its size is normally ranges from 4 to 16KBytes, with the rest of address space available for program memory. These devices execute instructions in place (in physical memory) and have no memory management unit (MMU) to support virtual memory. Our implementation focuses on MSP430. This choice is due to public availability of a well-maintained open-source MSP430 hardware design from Open Cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Nevertheless, our machine model and the entire methodology developed in this paper are applicable to other low-end MCUs in the same class, such as Atmel AVR ATmega.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Remote Attestation (RA)-architectures fall into three categories: hardware-based, software-based, or hybrid. Hardwarebased <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref> relies on dedicated secure hardware components, e.g., Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. However, the cost of such hardware is normally prohibitive for low-end IoT/CPS devices. Software-based attestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref> requires no hardware security features but imposes strong security assumptions about communication between P rv and V rf, which are unrealistic in the IoT/CPS ecosystem (though, it is the only choice for legacy devices). Hybrid RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30]</ref> aims to achieve security equivalent to hardware-based mechanisms at minimal cost. It thus entails minimal hardware requirements while relying on software to reduce overall complexity and RA footprint on P rv.</p><p>The first hybrid RA architecture -SMART <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> -acknowledged the importance of proving remote code execution on P rv, in addition to just attesting P rv's memory. Using an attest-thenexecute approach (see Algorithm 4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>), SMART attempts to provide software execution by specifying the address of the first instruction to be executed after completion of attestation. However, SMART offers no guarantees beyond "invoking the executable". It does not guarantee that execution completes successfully or that any produced outputs are tied to this execution. For example, SMART can not detect if execution is interrupted (e.g., by malware) and never resumed. A reset (e.g., due to software bugs, or P rv running low on power) might happen after invoking the executable, preventing its successful completion. Also, direct memory access (DMA) can occur during execution and it can modify the code being executed, its intermediate values in data memory, or its output. SMART neither detects nor prevents DMA-based attacks, since it assumes DMA-disabled devices.</p><p>Another notable RA architecture is TrustLite <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>, which builds upon SMART to allow secure interrupts. TrustLite does not enforce temporal consistency of attested memory; it is thus conceptually vulnerable to self-relocating malware and memory modification during attestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Consequently, it is challenging to deriving secure PoX from TrustLite. Several other prominent low-to-medium-end RA architectures -e.g., SANCUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, HYDRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and TyTaN <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> -do not offer PoX. In this paper, we show that the execute-then-attest approach, using a temporally consistent RA architecture, can be designed to provide unforgeable proofs of execution that are only produced if the expected software executes correctly and its results are untampered. Control Flow Attestation (CFA)-In contrast with RA, which measures P rv's software integrity, CFA techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref> provide V rf with a measurement of the exact control flow path taken during execution of specific software on P rv. Such measurements allow V rf to detect run-time attacks. We believe that it is possible to construct a PoX scheme that relies on CFA to produce proofs of execution based on the attested control flow path. However, in this paper, we advocate a different approach -specific for proofs of execution -for two main reasons:</p><p>• CFA requires substantial additional hardware features in order to attest, in real time, executed instructions along with memory addresses and the program counter. For example, C-FLAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> assumes ARM TrustZone, while LO-FAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and LiteHAX <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> require a branch monitor and a hash engine. We believe that such hardware components are not viable for low-end devices, since their cost (in terms of price, size, and energy consumption) is typically higher than the cost of a low-end MCU itself. For example, the cheapest Trusted Platform Module (TPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>, is about 10× more expensive than MSP430 MCU itself 1 .</p><p>1 Source: https://www.digikey.com/ As shown in Section 7.2, current CFA architectures are also considerably more expensive than the MCU itself and hence not realistic in our device context.</p><p>• CFA assumes that V rf can enumerate a large (potentially exponential!) number of valid control flow paths for a given program, and verify a valid response for each. This burden is unnecessary for determining if a proof of execution is valid, because one does not need to know the exact execution path in order to determine if execution occurred (and terminated) successfully; see Section 4.1 for a discussion on run-time threats.</p><p>Instead of relying on CFA, our work constructs a PoX-specific architecture -APEX-that enables low-cost PoX for low-end devices. APEX is non-invasive (i.e., it does not modify MCU behavior and semantics) and incurs low hardware overhead:</p><p>around 2% for registers and 12% for LUTs. Also, V rf is not required to enumerate valid control flow graphs and the verification burden for PoX is exactly the same as the effort to verify a typical remote attestation response for the same code.</p><p>Formally Verified Security Services-In recent years, several efforts focused on formally verifying security-critical systems. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Background</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Formal Verification, Model Checking &amp; Linear Temporal Logic</head><p>Computer-aided formal verification typically involves three basic steps. First, the system of interest (e.g., hardware, software, communication protocol) is described using a formal model, e.g., a Finite State Machine (FSM). Second, properties that the model should satisfy are formally specified. Third, the system model is checked against formally specified properties to guarantee that the system retains them. This can be achieved by either Theorem Proving or Model Checking. In this work, we use the latter to verify the implementation of system modules, and the former to derive new properties from sub-properties that were proved for the modules' implementation.</p><p>In one instantiation of model checking, properties are specified as formulae using Temporal Logic (TL) and system models are represented as FSMs. Hence, a system is represented by a triple (S, S 0 , T ), where S is a finite set of states, S 0 ⊆ S is the set of possible initial states, and T ⊆ S × S is the transition relation set -it describes the set of states that can be reached in a single step from each state. The use of TL to specify properties allows representation of expected system behavior over time.</p><p>We apply the widely used model checker NuSMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which can be used to verify generic HW or SW models. For digital hardware described at Register Transfer Level (RTL) -which is the case in this work -conversion from Hardware Description Language (HDL) to NuSMV model specification is simple. Furthermore, it can be automated <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, because the standard RTL design already relies on describing hardware as an FSM.</p><p>In NuSMV, properties are specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), which is particularly useful for verifying sequential systems, since LTL extends common logic statements with temporal clauses. In addition to propositional connectives, such as conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), negation (¬), and implication (→), LTL includes temporal connectives, thus enabling sequential reasoning. In this paper, we are interested in the following temporal connectives:</p><p>• Xφ -neXt φ: holds if φ is true at the next system state.</p><p>• Fφ -Future φ: holds if there exists a future state where φ is true.</p><p>• Gφ -Globally φ: holds if for all future states φ is true.</p><p>• φ U ψ -φ Until ψ: holds if there is a future state where ψ holds and φ holds for all states prior to that.</p><p>• φ B ψ -φ Before ψ: holds if the existence of state where ψ holds implies the existence of an earlier state where φ holds. This connective can be expressed using U through the equivalence: φ B ψ ≡ ¬(¬φ U ψ). This set of temporal connectives combined with propositional connectives (with their usual meanings) allows us to specify powerful rules. NuSMV works by checking LTL specifications against the system FSM for all reachable states in such FSM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Formally Verified RA</head><p>VRASED <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is a formally verified hybrid (hardware/software co-design) RA architecture, built as a set of sub-modules, each guaranteeing a specific set of sub-properties. All VRASED submodules, both hardware and software, are individually verified. Finally, the composition of all sub-modules is proved to satisfy formal definitions of RA soundness and security. RA soundness guarantees that an integrity-ensuring function (HMAC in VRASED's case) is correctly computed on the exact memory being attested. Moreover, it guarantees that attested memory remains unmodified after the start of RA computation, protecting against "hide-and-seek" attacks caused by self-relocating malware <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. RA security ensures that RA execution generates an unforgeable authenticated memory measurement and that the secret key K used in computing this measurement is not leaked before, during, or after, attestation.</p><p>To achieve aforementioned goals, VRASED software (SW-Att) is stored in Read-Only Memory (ROM) and relies on a formally verified HMAC implementation from HACL* cryptographic library <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. A typical execution of SW-Att is carried out as follows:</p><p>1. Read challenge C hal from memory region MR.</p><p>2. Derive a one-time key from C hal and the attestation master key K using an HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (KDF). 3. Generate an attestation token H by computing an HMAC over an attested memory region AR using the derived key: H = HMAC(KDF(K , MR), AR) 4. Write H into MR and return the execution to unprivileged software, i.e, normal applications. VRASED hardware (HW-Mod) monitors 7 MCU signals:</p><p>• PC: Current Program Counter value;</p><p>• R en : Signal that indicates if the MCU is reading from memory (1-bit); • W en : Signal that indicates if the MCU is writing to memory (1-bit); • D addr : Address for an MCU memory access;</p><p>• DMA en : Signal that indicates if Direct Memory Access (DMA) is currently enabled (1-bit); • DMA addr : Memory address being accessed by DMA.</p><p>• irq: Signal that indicates if an interrupt is happening (1-bit); These signals are used to determine a one-bit reset signal output. Whenever reset is set to 1 a system-wide MCU reset is triggered immediately, i.e., before the execution of the next instruction. This condition is triggered whenever VRASED's hardware detects any violation of its security properties. VRASED hardware is described in Register Transfer Level (RTL) using Finite State Machines (FSMs). Then, NuSMV Model Checker <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is used to automatically prove that such FSMs achieve claimed security sub-properties. Finally, the proof that the conjunction of hardware and software sub-properties implies end-to-end soundness and security is done using an LTL theorem prover.</p><p>More formally, VRASED end-to-end security proof guarantees that no probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) adversary can win the RA security game (See Definition 7 in Appendix B) with non-negligible probability in terms of the security parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Proof of Execution (PoX) Schemes</head><p>A Proof of Execution (PoX) is a scheme involving two parties:</p><p>(1) a trusted verifier V rf, and (2) an untrusted (potentially infected) remote prover P rv. Informally, the goal of PoX is to allow V rf to request execution of specific software S by P rv. As part of PoX, P rv must reply to V rf with an authenticated unforgeable cryptographic proof (H ) that convinces V rf that P rv indeed executed S. To accomplish this, verifying H must prove that: (1) S executed atomically, in its entirety, and that such execution occurred on P rv (and not on some other device);</p><p>and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(2)</ref> any claimed result/output value of such execution, that is accepted as legitimate by V rf, could not have been spoofed or modified. Also, the size and behavior (i.e., instructions) of S, as well as the size of its output (if any), should be configurable and optionally specified by V rf. In other words, PoX should provide proofs of execution for arbitrary software, along with corresponding authenticated outputs. Definition 1 specifies PoX schemes in detail.</p><p>We now justify the need to include atomic execution of S in the definition of PoX. On low-end MCUs, software typically runs on "bare metal" and, in most cases, there is no mechanism to enforce memory isolation between applications. Therefore, allowing S execution to be interrupted would permit other (potentially malicious) software running on P rv to alter the behavior of S. This might be done, for example, by an application that interrupts execution of S and changes intermediate computation results in S data memory, thus tampering with its output or control flow. Another example is an interrupt that resumes S at different instruction modifying S execution flow. Such actions could modify S behavior completely via return oriented programming (ROP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">PoX Adversarial Model &amp; Security Definition</head><p>We consider an adversary Adv that controls P rv's entire software state, code, and data. Adv can modify any writable memory and read any memory that is not explicitly protected by hardware-enforced access control rules. Adv may also have full control over all Direct Memory Access (DMA) controllers of P rv. Recall that DMA allows a hardware controller to directly access main memory (e.g., RAM, flash or ROM) without going through the CPU.</p><p>We consider a scheme PoX = (XRequest, XAtomicExec, XProve, XVerify) to be secure if the aforementioned Adv has only negligible probability of convincing V rf that S executed successfully when, in reality, such execution did not take place, or was interrupted. In addition we require that, if execution of S occurs, Adv can not tamper with, or influence, this execution's outputs. These notions are formalized by the security game in Definition 2.</p><p>We note that Definition 2 binds execution of S to the time between V rf issuing the request and receiving the response.</p><p>Therefore, if a PoX scheme is secure according to this definition, V rf can be certain about freshness of the execution. In the same vein, the output produced by such execution is also guaranteed to be fresh. This timeliness property is important to avoid replays of previous valid executions; in fact, it is essential for safety-critical applications. See Section 7.3 for examples.</p><p>Correctness of the Executable: we stress that the purpose of PoX is to guarantee that S, as specified by V rf, was executed. Similar to Trusted Execution Environments targeting high-end CPUs, such as Intel SGX, PoX schemes do not aim to check correctness and absence of implementation bugs in S. As such, it is not concerned with run-time attacks that exploit bugs and vulnerabilities in S implementation itself, to change its expected behavior (e.g., by executing S with inputs crafted to exploit S bugs and hijack its control flow). In particular, correctness of S need not be assured by the low-end P rv.</p><p>Since V rf is a more powerful device and knows S, it has the ability (and more computational resources) to employ various vulnerability detection methods (e.g., fuzzing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or static analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) or even software formal verification (depending on the level of rigor desired) to avoid or detect implementation bugs in S. This type of techniques can be performed offline before sending S to P rv and the whole issue is orthogonal to the PoX functionality.

We review these assumptions throughout the rest of this section and then formalize them as an LTL machine model in Section 6. Verification of the entire CPU is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, we assume the CPU architecture strictly adheres to, and correctly implements, its specifications. In particular, our design and verification rely on the following simple axioms: A1 -Program Counter (PC): PC always contains the address of the instruction being executed in a given CPU cycle. A Proof of Execution (PoX) scheme is a tuple of algorithms <ref type="bibr">[XRequest, XAtomicExec, XProve, XVerify]</ref> performed between P rv and V rf where:</p><p>1. XRequest V rf→P rv (S , ·): is an algorithm executed by V rf which takes as input some software S (consisting of a list of instructions {s 1 , s 2 , ..., s m }).</p><p>V rf expects an honest P rv to execute S. XRequest generates a challenge C hal, and embeds it alongside S, into an output request message asking P rv to execute S, and to prove that such execution took place.</p><p>2. XAtomicExec P rv (ER, ·): an algorithm (with possible hardware-support) that takes as input some executable region ER in P rv's memory, containing a list of instructions {i 1 , i 2 , ..., i m }. XAtomicExec runs on P rv and is considered successful iff: (1) instructions in ER are executed from its first instruction, i 1 , and end at its last instruction, i m ; (2) ER's execution is atomic, i.e., if E is the sequence of instructions executed between i 1 and i m , then {e|e ∈ E} ⊆ ER; and (3) ER's execution flow is not altered by external events, i.e., MCU interrupts or DMA events. The XAtomicExec algorithm outputs result string O. Note that O may be a default string (⊥) if ER's execution does not result in any output.</p><p>3. XProve P rv (ER, C hal, O,·): an algorithm (with possible hardware-support) that takes as input some ER, C hal and O and is run by P rv to output H , i.e., a proof that XRequest V rf→P rv (S , ·) and XAtomicExec P rv (ER, ·) happened (in this sequence) and that O was produced by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">XAtomicExec P rv (ER, ·).</formula><p>4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">APEX: A Secure PoX Architecture</head><p>We now present APEX, a new PoX architecture that realizes the PoX security definition in Definition 2. The key aspect of APEX is a computer-aided formally verified and publicly available implementation thereof. This section first provides some intuition behind APEX's design. All APEX properties are overviewed informally in this section and are later formalized in Section 6. In the rest of this section we use the term "unprivileged Definition 3 (Proof of Execution Protocol). APEX instantiates a PoX = (XRequest, XAtomicExec, XProve, XVerify) scheme behaving as follows:</p><p>1. XRequest V rf→P rv (S , ER min , ER max , OR min , OR max ): includes a set of configuration parameters ER min , ER max , OR min , OR max . The Executable Range (ER) is a contiguous memory block in which S is to be installed: ER = [ER min , ER max ]. Similarly, the Output Range (OR) is also configurable and defined by V rf's request as OR = [OR min , OR max ]. If S does not produce any output OR min = OR max =⊥. S is the software to be installed in ER and executed. If S is unspecified (S =⊥) the protocol will execute whatever code was pre-installed on ER on P rv, i.e., V rf is not required to provide S in every request, only when it wants to update ER contents before executing it. If the code for S is sent by V rf, untrusted auxiliary software in P rv is responsible for copying S into ER. P rv also receives a random l-bit challenge C hal (|C hal| = l) as part of the request, where l is the security parameter.</p><p>2. XAtomicExec P rv (ER, OR, METADATA): This algorithm starts with unprivileged auxiliary software writing the values of: ER min , ER max , OR min , OR max and C hal to a special pre-defined memory region denoted by METADATA. APEX's verified hardware enforces immutability, atomic execution and access control rules according to the values stored in METADATA; details are described in Section 5.1. Finally, it begins execution of S by setting the program counter to the value of ER min .</p><p>3. XProve P rv (ER, C hal, OR): produces proof of execution H . H allows V rf to decide whether: (1) code contained in ER actually executed; (2) ER contained specified (expected) S's code during execution; (3) this execution is fresh, i.e., performed after the most recent XRequest; and <ref type="formula">(4)</ref> claimed output in OR is indeed produced by this execution. As mentioned earlier, APEX uses VRASED's RA architecture to compute H by attesting at least the executable, along with its output, and corresponding execution metadata. More formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">H = HMAC(KDF(K , C hal), ER, OR, METADATA, ...)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>METADATA also contains the EXEC flag that is read-only to all software running in P rv and can only be written to by APEX's formally verified hardware. This hardware monitors execution and sets EXEC = 1 only if ER executed successfully (XAtomicExec) and memory regions of METADATA, ER, and OR were not modified between the end of ER's execution and the computation of H . The reasons for these requirements are detailed in Section 5.2. If any malware residing on P rv attempts to violate any of these properties APEX's verified hardware (provably) sets EXEC to zero. After computing H , P rv returns it and contents of OR (O) produced by ER's execution to V rf.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">4. XVerify P rv→V rf (H , O,S,METADATA V rf ) :</formula><p>Upon receiving H and O, V rf checks whether H is produced by a legitimate execution of S and reflects parameters specified in XRequest, i.e., METADATA V rf = C hal||OR min ||OR max ||ER min ||ER max ||EXEC = 1. This way, V rf concludes that S successfully executed on P rv and produced output O if: software" to refer to any software other than SW-Att code from VRASED. Adv is allowed to overwrite or bypass any "unprivileged software". Meanwhile, "trusted software" refers to VRASED's implementation of SW-Att (see Section 3) which is formally verified and can not be modified by Adv, since it is stored in ROM. APEX is designed such that no changes to SW-Att are required. Therefore, both functionalities (RA and PoX, i.e., VRASED and APEX) can co-exist on the same device without interfering with each other. Notation is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">H ≡ HMAC(KDF(K , C hal V rf ), S,O,METADATA V rf , ...)<label>(2)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Protocol and Architecture</head><p>Figure 1: Overview of APEX's workflow APEX implements a secure PoX = (XRequest, XAtomicExec, XProve, XVerify) scheme conforming to Definition 3. The steps in APEX workflow are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The main idea is to first execute code contained in ER. Then, at some later time, APEX invokes VRASED verified RA functionality to attest the code in ER and include, in the attestation result, additional information that allows V rf to verify that ER code actually executed. If ER execution produces an output (e.g., P rv is a sensor running ER's code to obtain some physical/ambient quantity), authenticity and integrity of this output can also be verified. That is achieved by including the EXEC flag among inputs to HMAC computed as part of VRASED RA. The value of this flag is controlled by APEX formally verified hardware and its memory can not be written by any software running on P rv. APEX hardware module runs in parallel with the MCU, monitoring its behavior and deciding the value of EXEC accordingly. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> depicts APEX's architecture. In addition to VRASED hardware that provides secure RA by monitoring a set of CPU signals (see Section 3.2), APEX monitors values stored in the dedicated physical memory region called METADATA. METADATA contains addresses/pointers to memory boundaries of ER (i.e., ER min and ER max ) and memory boundaries of expected output: OR min and OR max . These addresses are sent by V rf as part of XRequest, and are configurable at run-time. The code S to be stored in ER is optionally 2 sent by V rf.</p><p>METADATA includes the EXEC flag, which is initialized to 0 and only changes from 0 to 1 (by APEX's hardware) when ER execution starts, i.e., when the PC points to ER min . Afterwards, any violation of APEX's security properties (detailed in Section 5.2) immediately changes EXEC back to 0. After a violation, the only way to set the flag back to 1 is to re-start execution of ER from the very beginning, i.e., with PC=ER min . In other words, APEX verified hardware makes sure that EXEC value covered by the HMAC's result (represented by H ) is 1, if and only if ER code executed successfully. As mentioned earlier, we consider an execution to be successful if it runs atomically (i.e., without being interrupted), from its first ER min to its last instruction ER max .</p><p>In addition to EXEC, HMAC covers a set of parameters (in METADATA memory region) that allows V rf to check whether executed software was indeed located in ER =</p><p>[ER min , ER max ]. If any output is expected, V rf specifies a memory range OR = [OR min , OR max ] for storing output. Contents of OR are also covered by the computed HMAC, allowing V rf to verify authenticity of the output of the execution.</p><p>Remark: Our notion of successful execution requires S to have a single exit point -ER max . Any self-contained code with multiple legal exits can be trivially instrumented to have a single exit point by replacing each exit instruction with a jump to the unified exit point ER max . This notion also requires S to run atomically. Since this constraint might be undesirable for some real-time systems, we discuss how to relax it in Section 8. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Sending the code to be executed is optional because S might be preinstalled on P rv. In that case the proof of execution will allow V rf to conclude that the pre-installed S was not modified and that it was executed. In addition, V rf is responsible for defining OR memory region according to S behavior. OR should be large enough to fit all output produced by S and OR boundaries should correspond to addresses where S writes its output values to be sent to V rf.</p></div>

This may be necessary if not all ER execution paths overwrite OR entirely. We clarify that requirements for APEX might conflict with existing memory-based security mechanisms, such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), or (Kernel) Address Space Layout Randomization (K)ASLR. However, such techniques are applicable to higher-end platforms and are not present on low-end platforms targeted by APEX (see "Targeted Devices &amp; Scope" in Section 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">APEX's Sub-Properties at a High-Level</head><p>We now describe sub-properties enforced by APEX. Section 6 formalizes them in LTL and provides a single end-to-end definition of APEX correctness. This end-to-end correctness notion is provably implied by the composition of all sub-properties. Subproperties fall into two major groups: Execution Protection and Metadata Protection. A violation of any of these properties implies one or more of:</p><p>• Code in ER was not executed atomically and in its entirety; • Output in OR was not produced by ER execution;</p><p>• Code in ER was not executed in a timely manner, i.e., after receiving the latest XRequest. Whenever APEX detects a violation, EXEC is set to 0. Since EXEC is included among inputs to the computation of HMAC (conveyed in P rv's response), it will be interpreted by V rf as failure to prove execution of code in ER. Remark: We emphasize that properties discussed below are required in addition to VRASED verified properties, i.e., these are entirely different properties used specifically to enforce PoX security and should not be viewed as replacements for any of VRASED properties that are used to enforce RA security.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">Execution Protection:</head><p>EP1 -Ephemeral Immutability: Code in ER can not be modified from the start of its execution until the end of SW-Att computation in XProve routine. This property is necessary to ensure that the attestation result reflects the code that executed.</p><p>Lack of this property would allow Adv to execute some other code ER Adv , overwrite it with expected ER and finally call XProve. This would result in a valid proof of execution of ER even though ER Adv was executed instead. EP2 -Ephemeral Atomicity: ER execution is only considered successful if ER runs starting from ER min until ER max atomically, i.e., without any interruption. This property conforms with XAtomicExec routine in Definition 1 and with the notion of successful execution in the context of our work. As discussed in Section 4, ER must run atomically to prevent malware residing on P rv from interrupting ER execution and resuming it at a different instruction, or modifying intermediate execution results in data memory. Without this property, Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and similar attacks on ER could change its behavior completely and unpredictably, making any proof of execution (and corresponding output) useless. EP3 -Output Protection: Similar to EP1, APEX must ensure that OR is unmodified from the time after ER code execution is finished until completion of HMAC computation in XProve.</p><p>Lack of this property would allow Adv to overwrite OR and successfully spoof OR produced by ER, thus convincing V rf that it produced output OR Adv .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Metadata Protection:</head><p>MP1 -Executable/Output (ER/OR) Boundaries: APEX hardware ensures properties EP1, EP2, and EP3 according to values: ER min , ER max , OR min , OR max . These values are configurable and can be decided by V rf based on application needs. V rf's challenge must be unforgeable and non-invertible. Therefore, in the XProve routine, K used to compute HMAC must never be leaked (with non-negligible probability) and HMAC implementation must be functionally correct, i.e., adhere to its cryptographic specification. Moreover, contents of memory being attested must not change during HMAC computation. We rely on VRASED to ensure these properties. Also, to ensure trustworthiness of the response, APEX guarantees that no software in P rv can ever modify EXEC flag and that, once EXEC = 0, it can only become 1 if ER's execution re-starts afresh. MP3 -Challenge Temporal Consistency: APEX must ensure that C hal can not be modified between ER's execution and HMAC computation in XProve. Without this property, the following attack is possible: (1) P rv-resident malware executes ER properly (i.e., by not violating EP1-EP3 and MP1-MP2), resulting in EXEC = 1 after execution stops, and (2) at a later time, malware receives C hal from V rf and simply calls XProve on this C hal without executing ER. As a result, malware would acquire a valid proof of execution (since EXEC remains 1 when the proof is generated) even though no ER execution occurred before C hal was received. Such attacks are prevented by setting EXEC = 0 whenever the memory region storing C hal is modified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Formal Specification &amp; Verified Implementation</head><p>Our formal verification approach starts by formalizing APEX sub-properties Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define invariants that must hold throughout the MCU operation. We then use a theorem prover <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to write a computer-aided proof that the conjunction of the LTL sub-properties imply an end-toend formal definition for the guarantee expected from APEX hardware. APEX correctness, when properly composed with VRASED guarantees, yields a PoX scheme secure according to Definition 2. This is proved by showing that, if the composition between the two is implemented as described in Definition 3, VRASED security can be reduced to APEX security. APEX hardware module is composed of several sub-modules written in Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). Each sub-module is responsible for enforcing a set of LTL sub-properties and is described as an FSM in Verilog at Register Transfer Level (RTL). Individual sub-modules are combined into a single Verilog design. The resulting composition is converted to the SMV model checking language using the automatic translation tool Verilog2SMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>. The resulting SMV is simultaneously verified against all LTL specifications, using the model checker NuSMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, to prove that the final Verilog of APEX complies with all necessary properties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Machine Model</head><p>Definition 4 models, in LTL, the behavior of low-end MCUs considered in this work. It consists of a subset of the machine model introduced by VRASED. Nonetheless, this subset models all MCU behavior relevant for stating and verifying correctness of APEX's implementation.</p><p>Modify _ Mem models that a given memory address can be modified by a CPU instruction or by a DMA access. In the former, W en signal must be set and D addr must contain the target memory address. In the latter, DMA en signal must be set and DMA addr must contain the target DMA address. The requirements for reading from a memory address are similar, except that instead of W en , R en must be on. We do not explicitly state this behavior since it is not used in APEX proofs. For the same reason, modeling the effects of instructions that only modify register values (e.g., ALU operations, such as add and mul) is also not necessary. The machine model also captures the fact that, when an interrupt happens during execution, the irq signal in MCU hardware is set to 1. With respect to memory layout, the model states that MR, CR, AR, KR, XS, and METADATA are disjoint memory regions. The first five memory regions are defined in VRASED. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, METADATA is a fixed memory region used by APEX to store information about software execution status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Security &amp; Implementation Correctness</head><p>We use a two-part strategy to prove that APEX is a secure PoX architecture, according to Definition 2:</p><p>[A]: We show that properties EP1-EP3 and MP1-MP3, discussed in Section 5.2 and formally specified next in Section 6.3, are sufficient to guarantee that EXEC flag is 1 iff S indeed executed on P rv. To show this, we compose a computer proof using SPOT LTL proof assistant <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">[B]</ref>: We use cryptographic reduction proofs to show that, as long as part A holds, VRASED security can be reduced to APEX's PoX security from Definition 2. In turn, HMAC's existential unforgeability can be reduced to VRASED's security <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Therefore, both APEX and VRASED rely on the assumption that HMAC is a secure MAC. In the rest of this section, we convey the intuition behind both of these steps. Proof details are in Appendix B.</p><p>The goal of part A is to show that APEX's sub-properties imply Definition 5. LTL specification in Definition 5 captures the conditions that must hold in order for EXEC to be set to 1 during execution of XProve, enabling generation of a valid proof of execution. This specification ensures that, in order to have EXEC = 1 during execution of XProve (i.e, for [EXEC ∧ PC ∈ CR] to hold), at least once before such time the following must have happened:</p><p>1. The system reached state S 0 where software stored in ER started executing from its first instruction (PC = ER min ). 2. The system eventually reached a state S 1 when ER finished executing (PC = ER max ). In the interval between S 0 and S 1 PC kept executing instructions within ER, there were no interrupts, no resets, and DMA remained inactive. 3. The system eventually reached a state S 2 when XProve started executing (PC = CR min ). In the interval between S 0 and S 2 , METADATA and ER regions were not modified. 4. In the interval between S 0 and S 2 , OR region was only modified by ER's execution, i.e., PC ∈ ER ∨ ¬ Modify_Mem(OR). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the time windows wherein each memory region must not change during APEX's PoX as implied by APEX's correctness (Definition 5). Violating any of these conditions will cause EXEC have value 0 during XProve's computation.</p><p>Consequently, any violation will result in V rf rejecting the proof of execution since it will not conform to the expected value of H , per Equation 2 in Definition 3.</p><p>The intuition behind the cryptographic reduction (part B) is that computing H involves simply invoking VRASED SW-Att with MR = C hal, ER ∈ AR, OR ∈ AR, and METADATA ∈ AR. Therefore, a successful forgery of APEX's H implies breaking VRASED security. Since H always includes the value of EXEC, this implies that APEX is PoX-secure (Definition 2). The complete reduction is presented in Appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">APEX's Sub-Properties in LTL</head><p>We formalize the necessary sub-properties enforced by APEX as LTL specifications 3-12 in Definition 6.

Appendix B discusses a computer proof that the conjunction of this set of properties is sufficient to satisfy a formal definition of APEX correctness from Definition 5.</p><p>LTL 3 enforces EP1 -Ephemeral immutability by making sure that whenever ER memory region is written by either CPU or DMA, EXEC is immediately set to logical 0 (false).</p><p>EP2 -Ephemeral Atomicity is enforced by a set of three LTL specifications. LTL 4 enforces that the only way for ER's execution to terminate, without setting EXEC to logical 0, is through its last instruction: PC = ER max . This is specified by checking the relation between current and next PC values using LTL neXt operator. In particular, if current PC value is within ER, and next PC value is outside SW-Att region, then either current PC value is the address of ER max , or EXEC is set to 0 in the next cycle. Also, LTL 5 enforces that the only way for PC to enter ER is through the very first instruction: ER min . This prevents ER execution from starting at some point in the middle of ER, thus making sure that ER always executes in its entirety. Finally, LTL 6 enforces that EXEC is set to zero if an interrupt happens in the middle of ER execution. Even though LTLs 4 and 5 already enforce that PC can not change to anywhere outside ER, interrupts could be programmed to return to an arbitrary instruction within ER. Although this would not violate LTLs 4 and 5, it would still modify ER's behavior.

We implement the hardware architecture shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. In addition to APEX and VRASED modules in HW-Mod, we implement a peripheral module responsible for storing and maintaining APEX METADATA. As a peripheral, contents of METADATA can be accessed in a pre-defined memory address via standard peripheral memory access. We also ensure that EXEC (located inside METADATA) is unmodifiable in software by removing software-write wires in hardware. Finally, as a proof of concept, we use Xilinx Vivado to synthesize an RTL description of the modified HW-Mod and deploy it on the Artix-7 FPGA class. Prototyping using FPGAs is common in both research and industry. Once a hardware design is synthesizable in an FPGA, the same design can be used to manufacture an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) on a larger scale.</p></div>

Similar to the related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>, we consider the hardware overhead in terms of additional LUTs and registers. The increase in the number of LUTs can be used as an estimate of the additional chip cost and size required for combinatorial logic, while the number of registers offers an estimate on the memory overhead required by the sequential logic in APEX FSMs. APEX hardware overhead is small compared to the baseline VRASED; it requires 2% and 12% additional registers and LUTs, respectively. In absolute numbers, it adds 44 registers and 302 Look-Up <ref type="table">Tables (LUTs) to</ref>  CPU. Run-time to produce a proof of S execution includes: (1) time to execute S (XAtomicExec), and (2) time to compute an attestation token (XProve). The former only depends on S behavior itself (e.g., SW-Att can be a small sequence of instructions or have long loops). As mentioned earlier, APEX does not affect S run time. XProve's run-time is linear in the size of ER + OR. In the worst-case scenario where these regions occupy the entire program 8kBytes memory, XProve takes around 900ms on an 8MHz device. Verification Cost. We verify APEX on an Ubuntu 16.04 machine running at 3.40GHz. Results are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref>. APEX verification requires checking 10 extra invariants (shown in Definition 6) in addition to existing VRASED invariants. It also consumes significantly higher run-time and memory usage than VRASED verification. This is because additional invariants introduce five additional variables (ER min , ER max , OR min , OR max and EXEC), potentially resulting in an exponential increase in complexity of the model checking process. Nonetheless, the overall verification process is still reasonable for a commodity desktop -it takes around 3 minutes and consumes 280MB of memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Comparison with CFA</head><p>To the best of our knowledge, APEX is the first of its kind and thus there are no other directly comparable PoX architectures. However, to provide a (performance and overhead) point of reference and a comparison, we contrast APEX overhead with that state-of-the-art CFA architectures. As discussed in Section 2, even though CFA is not directly applicable for producing proofs of execution with authenticated outputs, we consider it to be the closest-related service, since it reports on the exact execution path of a program. We consider three recent CFA architectures: Atrium [44], LiteHAX <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and LO-FAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>.a compares APEX to these architectures in terms of number of additional LUTs. In this figure, the black dashed line represents the total cost of the MSP430 MCU: 1904 LUTs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>.b presents a similar comparison for the amount of additional registers required by these architectures. In this case, the total cost of the MSP430 MCU itself is of 691 registers. Finally, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>.c presents the amount of dedicated RAM required by these architectures (APEX's dedicated RAM corresponds to the exclusive access stack implemented by VRASED).</p><p>As expected, APEX incurs much lower overhead. According to our results, the cheapest CFA architecture, LiteHAX, would entail an overhead of nearly 100% LUTs and 300% registers, on MSP430. In addition, LiteHAX would require 150 kB of dedicated RAM. This amount far exceeds entire addressable memory (64 kB) of 16-bit processors, such as MSP430. Results support our claim that CFA is not applicable to this class of low-end devices. Meanwhile, APEX needs a total of 12% additional LUTs and 2% additional registers. VRASED requires about 2 kB of reserved RAM, which is not increased by APEX PoX support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Proof of Concept: Authenticated Sensing and Actuation</head><p>As discussed in Section 1 an important functionality attainable with PoX is authenticated sensing/actuation. In this section, we demonstrate how to use APEX to build sensors and actuators that "can not lie".</p><p>As a running example we use a fire sensor: a safety-critical low-end embedded device commonly present in households and workplaces. It consists of an MCU equipped with analog hardware for measuring physical/chemical quantities, e.g., temperature, humidity, and CO 2 level. It is also usually equipped with actuation-capable analog hardware, such as a buzzer. Analog hardware components are directly connected to MCU General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) ports. GPIO ports are physical wires directly mapped to fixed memory locations in MCU memory. Therefore, software running on the MCU can read physical quantities directly from GPIO memory.</p><p>In this example, we consider that MCU software periodically reads these values and transmits them to a remote safety authority, e.g., a fire department, which then decides whether to take action. The MCU also triggers the buzzer actuator whenever sensed values indicate a fire. Given the safety-critical nature of this application, the safety authority must be assured that reported values are authentic and were produced by execution of expected software. Otherwise, malware could spoof such values (e.g., by not reading them from the proper GPIO). PoX guarantees that reported values were read from the correct GPIO port (since the memory address is specified by instructions in the ER executable), and produced output (stored in OR) was indeed generated by execution of ER and was unmodified thereafter. Thus, upon receiving sensed values accompanied by a PoX, the safety authority is assured that the reported sensed value can be trusted.</p><p>As a proof of concept, we use APEX to implement a simple fire sensor that operates with temperature and humidity quantities. It communicates with a remote V rf (e.g., the fire department) using a low-power ZigBee radio 3 typically used by low-end CPS/IoT devices. Temperature and humidity analog devices are connected to a APEX-enabled MSP430 MCU running at 8MHz and synthesized using a Basys3 Artix-7 FPGA board. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>, MCU GPIO ports connected to the temperature/humidity sensor and to the buzzer. APEX is used to prove execution of the fire sensor software. This software is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 8a</ref> in Appendix C. It consists of two main functions: ReadSensor and SoundAlarm. Proofs of execution are requested by the safety authority via XRequest to issue commands to execute these functions. ReadSensor reads and processes the value generated by temperature/humidity analog device memory-mapped GPIO, and copies this value to OR. The SoundAlarm function turns the buzzer on for 2 seconds, i.e., it writes "1" to the memory address mapped to the buzzer, busy-waits for 2 seconds, and then writes "0" to the same memory location. This implementation corresponds to the one in the open-source repository <ref type="bibr">4</ref> and was ported to a APEX-enabled MCU. The porting effort was minimal: it involved around 30 additional lines of C code, mainly for reimplementing sub-functions originally implemented as shared APIs, e.g., digitalRead/Write. Finally, we transformed ported code to be compatible with APEX's PoX architecture. Details can be found in Appendix C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Limitations &amp; Future Directions</head><p>In the following we discuss some limitations in APEX current approach and directions for future work.</p><p>Shared libraries. In order to produce a valid proof, V rf must ensure that execution of S does not depend on external code located outside the executable range ER (e.g., shared libraries). A call to such code would violate LTL 4, resulting in EXEC = 0 during the attestation computation. To support this type of executable one can transform it into a self-contained executable by statically linking all dependencies during the compilation time.</p><p>Self-modifying code (SMC). SMC is a type of executable that alters itself while executing. Clearly, this executable type violates LTL 3 that requires code in ER to remain unchanged during ER's execution. It is unclear how APEX can be adapted to support SMC; however, we are unaware of any legitimate and realistic use-case of SMC in our targeted platforms.</p><p>Atomic Execution &amp; Interrupts. The notion of successful execution, defined in Section 5.1, prohibits interruptions during S's execution. This limitation can be problematic especially on systems with strict real-time constraints. In this case, the PoX executable might be interrupted by a higher priority task and, in order to provide a valid proof of execution, execution must start over. On the other hand, simply resuming S execution after an interrupt may result in attacks where malware modifies intermediate execution results, in data memory, consequently influencing the correctness of this execution's output. One possible way to remedy this issue is to allow interrupts as long as all interrupt handlers are: (1) themselves immutable and uninterruptible from the start of execution until the end of attestation; and (2) included in the attested memory range during the attestation process. V rf could then use the PoX result H to determine whether an interrupt that may have happened during the execution is malicious. This idea needs to be examined carefully, because even the accurate definition of PoX correctness and security in this case becomes challenging. The   <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref> and SGX <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> can provide PoX on high-end devices, the trusted components in these architectures (i.e., TPM and processor's architectural support) are not yet verified. It would also be interesting to investigate whether APEX can be designed and implemented as a standalone device (e.g., a tiny verified TPM-alike device) that can be plugged into legacy low-end devices. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this approach require further investigation; this is because hybrid-architectures (such as SMART, VRASED, and APEX) monitor internal MCU signals (e.g., PC, or DMA signals) that are not exposed to external devices via communication/IO channels. It would also be interesting to see what kinds of trusted applications can be bootstrapped and built on top of a PoX service for low-end devices. Finally, in the near-future, we plan to look into techniques that can automatically transform legacy code into PoX-compatible software (see Appendix C) and to investigate how to enable stateful PoX, where one large PoX code could be broken down into multiple smaller pieces of atomic code and secure interruptions are allowed in between the execution of two pieces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Conclusion</head><p>This paper introduces APEX, a novel and formally verified security service targeting low-end embedded devices. It allows a remote untrusted prover to generate unforgeable proofs of remote software execution. We envision APEX's use in many IoT application domains, such as authenticated sensing and actuation. Our implementation of APEX is realized on a real embedded system platform, MSP430, synthesized on an FPGA, and the verified implementation is publicly available. Our evaluation shows that APEX has low overhead for both hardware footprint and time for generating proofs of execution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>APPENDIX A Sub-Module Verification</head><p>APEX is designed as a set of seven sub-modules. We now describe APEX's verified implementation, by focusing on two of these sub-modules and their corresponding properties. The Verilog implementation of omitted sub-modules is available in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Each sub-module enforces a sub-set of the LTL specifications in Definition 6. As discussed in Section 6, sub-modules are designed as FSMs. In particular, we implement them as Mealy FSMs, i.e, their output changes as a function of both the current state and current input values. Each FSM takes as input a subset of the signals shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and produces only one output -EXEC -indicating violations of PoX properties.</p><p>To simplify the presentation, we do not explicitly represent the value of EXEC for each state transition. Instead, we define the following implicit representation:</p><p>1. EXEC is 0 whenever an FSM transitions to NotExec state. 2. EXEC remains 0 until a transition leaving NotExec state is triggered. 3. EXEC is 1 in all other states. 4. Sub-modules composition: Since all PoX properties must simultaneously hold, the value of EXEC produced by APEX is the conjunction (logical AND) of all submodules' individual EXEC flags.  Figure 6 represents a verified model enforcing LTLs 4-6, corresponding to the high-level property EP2-Ephemeral Atomicity. The FSM consists of five states. notER and midER represent states when PC is: (1) outside ER, and (2) within ER respectively, excluding the first (ER min ) and last (ER max ) instructions. Meanwhile, f stER and lstER correspond to states when PC points to the first and last instructions, respectively.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(PC &lt; ERmin ∨ PC &gt; ERmax) PC = ERmin ∧ ¬ irq otherwise PC = ERmin ∧ ¬ irq (PC &gt; ERmin ∧ PC &lt; ERmax) ∧ ¬ irq otherwise (PC &gt; ERmin ∧ PC &lt; ERmax) ∧ ¬ irq PC = ERmax ∧ ¬ irq otherwise PC = ERmax ∧ ¬ irq (PC &lt; ERmin ∨ PC &gt; ERmax) ∧ ¬ irq otherwise</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Run</head><p>NotExec otherwise otherwise The only possible path from notER to midER is through f stER. Similarly, the only path from midER to notER is through lstER. A transition to the NotExec state is triggered whenever: (1) any sequence of values for PC do not follow the aforementioned conditions, or (2) irq is logical 1 while PC is inside ER. Lastly, the only way to transition out of the NotExec state is to restart ER's execution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7</ref> shows the FSM verified to comply with LTL 10 (MP3-Challenge Temporal Consistency). The FSM has two states: Run and NotExec. The FSM transitions to the NotExec state and outputs EXEC = 0 whenever a violation happens, i.e., whenever METADATA is modified in software. It transitions back to Run when ER's execution is restarted without such violation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">[Wen ∧ (Daddr ∈ METADATA)]∨ [DMAen ∧ (DMAaddr ∈ METADATA)] PC = ERmin∧ ¬[Wen ∧ (Daddr ∈ METADATA)]∧ ¬[DMAen ∧ (DMAaddr ∈ METADATA)]</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Proofs of Implementation Correctness &amp; Security</head><p>In this section we discuss the computer proof for APEX's implementation correctness <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Theorem 1)</ref>  proof for Theorem 1 is available at <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We here discuss the intuition behind such proof. Theorem 1 states that LTLs 3 -12, when considered in conjunction with the machine model in Definition 4, imply APEX's implementation correctness.</p><p>Recall that Definition 5 states that, in order to have EXEC = 1 during the computation of XProve, at least once before such event (EXEC = 1) the following must have happened:</p><p>1. The system reached state S 0 in which the software stored in ER started executing from its first instruction (PC = ER min ). 2. The system eventually reached a state S 1 when ER finished executing (PC = ER max ). In the interval between S 0 and S 1 PC remained executing instructions within ER, and there were no interrupts, no resets, and DMA remained inactive. 3. The system eventually reached a state S 2 when XProve started executing (PC = CR min ). In the interval between S 0 and S 2 the memory regions of METADATA and ER were not modified. 4. In the interval between S 0 and S 2 the OR memory region was only modified by ER's software execution (PC ∈ ER ∨ ¬ Modify_Mem(OR)). The first two properties to be noted are LTL 12 and LTL 11. LTL 12 establishes the default state of EXEC is 0. LTL 11 enforces that the only possible way to change EXEC from 0 to 1 is by having PC = ER min . In other words, EXEC is 1 during the computation of XProve only if, at some point before that, the code stored in ER started to execute (state S 0 ).</p><p>To see why state S 1 (when ER execution finishes, i.e., PC = ER max ) is reached with ER executing atomically until then, we look at LTLs 4, 5, 6, and 9. LTLs 4, 5 and 6 enforce that PC will stay inside ER until S 1 or otherwise EXEC will be set to 0. On the other hand, it is impossible to execute instructions of XProve (PC ∈ CR) without leaving ER, because LTL 9 guarantees that ER and CR do not overlap, or EXEC = 0.</p><p>So far we have argued that to have a token H that reflects EXEC = 1 the code contained in ER must have executed successfully. What remains to be shown is: producing this token implies the code in ER and METADATA are not modified in the interval between S 0 and S 2 and only ER's execution can modify OR in the same time interval.</p><p>Clearly, the contents of ER can not be modified after S 0 because Modify_Mem(ER) directly implies that LTL 3 will set EXEC = 0. The same reasoning is applicable for modifications to METADATA region with respect to LTL 10. The same argument applies to modifying OR, with the only exception that OR modifications are allowed only by the CPU and when PC ∈ ER (LTL 7). This means that OR can only be modified by the execution of ER. In addition, LTL 7 also ensures that DMA is disabled during the execution of ER to prevent unauthorized modification of intermediate results in data memory. Therefore, the timeline presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> is strictly implied by APEX's implementation. This concludes the reasoning behind Theorem 1.</p><p>Proof. (Theorem 2) Assume that Adv PoX is an adversary capable of winning the security game in Definition 2 against APEX with more than negligible probability. We show that, if such Adv PoX exists, then it can be used to construct (in a polynomial number of steps) Adv RA that wins VRASED's security game (Definition 7) with more than negligible probability. Therefore, by contradiction, nonexistence of Adv RA (i.e., VRASED's security) implies nonexistence of Adv PoX (APEX's security).</p><p>First we recall that, to win APEX's security game, Adv PoX must provide (H Adv , O Adv ), such that XVerify(H Adv , O Adv , S,C hal, ·) = 1.</p><p>To comply with conditions 3.a and 3.b in Definition 2, this must be done in either of the following two ways:</p><p>Case1 Adv PoX does not execute S in the time window between t req and t veri f (i.e., ¬XAtomicExec P rv (S ,t req → t veri f )).</p><p>Case2 Adv PoX calls XAtomicExec P rv (S ,t req → t veri f ) but modifies its output O in between the time when the execution of S completes and the time when XProve is called.</p><p>Theorem 2. APEX is secure according to Definition 2 as long as VRASED is a secure RA architecture according to Definition 7.</p><p>Definition 7.

In APEX's implementation, O is stored in region OR and S in region ER. Moreover,</p><p>given Theorem 1, we know that having EXEC = 1 during XProve implies three conditions have been fulfilled: Cond1 The code in ER executed successfully.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cond2</head><p>The code in ER and METADATA were not modified after starting ER's execution and before calling XProve. Cond3 Outputs in OR were not modified after completing ER's execution and before calling XProve.</p><p>The third condition rules out the possibility of Case2 since that case assumes Adv can modify O, resided in OR, after ER execution and EXEC stays logical 1 during XProve. We further break down Case1 into three sub-cases:</p><p>Case1.1 Adv PoX does not follow Cond1-Cond3. The only way for Adv PoX to produce (H Adv , O Adv ) in this case is not to call XProve and directly guess H . Case1.2 Adv PoX follows Cond1-Cond3 but does not execute S between t req and t veri f . Instead, it produces (H Adv , O Adv ) by calling:</p><p>O Adv ≡ XAtomicExec P rv (ER Adv ,t req → t veri f )</p><p>where ER Adv is a memory region different from the one specified by V rf on XRequest (Adv PoX can do this by modifying</p><p>METADATA to different values of ER min and ER max before calling XAtomicExec). Case1.3 Similar to Case1.2, with ER Adv being the same region specified by V rf on XRequest, but instead containing a different executable S Adv .</p><p>We show that an adversary that succeeds in any of these cases can be used win VRASED's security game. To see why this is the case, we note that APEX's XProve function is implemented by using VRASED's SW-Att. SW-Att covers memory regions MR (challenge memory) and AR (attested region). Hence, APEX instantiates these memory regions as: </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Definition 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Proof of Execution (PoX) Scheme).</figDesc></figure>

METADATA ⊂ AR; Doing so ensures that all sensitive memory regions used by APEX are included among the inputs to VRASED's attestation. Let X(t) denote the content in memory region X at time t. Adv RA can then be constructed using Adv PoX as follows:</p><p>1. Adv RA receives C hal from the challenger in step (2) of RA security game of Definition 7.</p><p>2. At arbitrary time t, Adv RA has 3 options to write AR(t) = AR Adv and call Adv PoX :</p><p>(b) Modify ER to be different from the range chosen by</p><p>In any of these options, Adv RA will produce (H Adv ,O Adv ), such that XVerify(H Adv , O Adv , S,C hal, ·) = 1 with non-negligible probability.</p><p>3. Adv RA replies to the challenger with the pair (M, H Adv ), where M corresponds to the values of S, O and METADATA V rf , matching H Adv and O Adv generated by Adv PoX . By construction M = AR Adv = AR(t), as required by Definition 7.</p><p>4. Challenger will accept (M, H Adv ) with the same non-negligible probability that Adv PoX has of producing (H Adv ,O Adv ) such that XVerify(H Adv , O Adv , S,C hal, ·) = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Software Transformation</head><p>Recall that the notion of successful execution (in Section 5.1) requires the executable's entry point to be at the first instruction in ER and the exit point to be at the last instruction in ER. In this section, we discuss how to efficiently transform arbitrary software to conform with this requirement. Lines 10-17 of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.a show a (partial) implementation of the ReadSensor function described in Section 7.3. This implementation, when converted to an executable, does not meet APEX's executable requirement, since the compiler may choose to place one of its sub-functions (instead of ReadSensor) as the entry and/or exit points of the executable. One way to fix this issue is to implement all of its sub-functions as inline functions. However, this may be inefficient; in this example, it would duplicate the code of the same sub-functions (e.g., digitalWrite) inside the executable.</p><p>Instead, we create dedicated functions for entry (Line 1-4) and exit (Line 6-8) points, and assign those functions to separate executable sections: ".exec.entry" for the entry and ".exec.exit" for the exit. Then, we label all sub-functions used by ReadSensor as well as ReadSensor itself to the same section -".exec.body" -and modify the MSP430 linker to place ".exec.body" between ".exec.entry" and ".exec.exit" sections. The modified linker script is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>.b.</p></div>			</div>
