			<abstract>
				<p>We present POSH, a framework that accelerates shell applications with I/O-heavy components, such as data analytics with command-line utilities. Remote storage such as networked filesystems can severely limit the performance of these applications: data makes a round trip over the network for relatively little computation at the client. Reducing the data movement by moving the code to the data can improve performance. POSH automatically optimizes unmodified I/O-intensive shell applications running over remote storage by offloading the I/O-intensive portions to proxy servers closer to the data. A proxy can run directly on a storage server, or on a machine closer to the storage layer than the client. POSH intercepts shell pipelines and uses metadata called annotations to decide where to run each command within the pipeline. We address three principal challenges that arise: an annotation language that allows POSH to understand which files a command will access, a scheduling algorithm that places commands to minimize data movement, and a system runtime to execute a distributed schedule but retain local semantics. We benchmark POSH on real shell pipelines such as image processing, network security analysis, log analysis, distributed system debugging, and git. We find that POSH provides speedups ranging from 1.6× to 15× compared to NFS, without requiring any modifications to the applications.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The UNIX shell is a linchpin in computing systems and workflows. Developers use many tools at the command-line level for data processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, from core bash utilities, including sort, head, cat and grep to more complicated programs such as git <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, ImageMagick <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> and FFmpeg <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Network security engineers use shell pipelines to find potential patterns in gigabytes of logs. The shell's continued importance over many decades and generations of computing systems shows just how flexible and powerful a tool it is.</p><p>The UNIX shell, however, was designed in a time dominated by local and then LAN storage, when file access was limited by disk access times, such that the overhead of network storage was an acceptable trade-off. Today, however, solid-state disks have reduced access times by orders of magnitude. At the same time, networked attached storage, especially for the enterprise, remains extremely popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60]</ref>. Mounting filesystems across the wide area could incur tens of milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, many applications use wide area storage systems, via cloud blob storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref> or cloud-backed filesystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58]</ref>.</p><p>Running I/O-intensive shell pipelines over the network requires transferring huge amounts of data for little computation. For example, consider generating a tar archive on NFS. The tar utility effectively copies the source files and adds a small amount of metadata: the server reads blocks and sends them over a network to a client, who shifts their offsets slightly and sends them back. NFS mitigates this problem by offering compound operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> and server-side support for primitive commands such as cp <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>. However, something as simple as tar requires large network transfers.</p><p>The result of these changing performance trends is that network transfer is an increasingly large overhead on shell scripts. For example, unzipping a dataset of size 0.5 GB with tar -x over NFS within a cloud datacenter takes 7× longer than on a local disk. While intra-datacenter networking is fast, it is not as fast as a local flash drive. Some workflows are so slow over the network that they are effectively unusable: running git status on the Chromium repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> takes 2 seconds locally, but if the repository is stored in a nearby datacenter, it takes over 20 minutes.</p><p>The underlying performance problem of using the shell with remote data is locality: because the shell executes locally, it must move large amounts of data to and from remote servers. Data movement is usually the most expensive (time and energy) part of a computation and shell workloads are no exception. Near-data processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref> can reduce data movement overheads. Data-parallel processing systems such as Spark <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>, stored procedures in SQL databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>, and native data structures in key-value stores such as Redis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> all bring computation closer to the data. However, many of these systems require applications to use their APIs: they can supplement, but not replace shell pipelines.</p><p>To address the shell performance problem of data locality, this paper proposes POSH, the "Process Offload Shell", a system that offloads portions of unmodified shell commands to proxy servers closer to the data. A proxy server can run on the actual remote fileserver storing the data, or on a different node that is much closer to the data (e.g., within the same datacenter) than the client. POSH improves shell-based I/O workloads through three techniques. First, it identifies parts of complex pipelines that can be safely offloaded to a proxy server. Second, it selects which candidates run on a proxy, in order to minimize network data movement. Finally, it executes the pipeline across an underlying runtime, stitching together the distributed computations while maintaining the exact output semantics expected by a local program. Correctly and efficiently implementing these three techniques has three principal challenges:</p><p>1. Correctly understanding the semantics of shell commandline invocations in order to deduce which files each command in the pipeline accesses and determine which commands can be offloaded. 2. Distributing the entire pipeline across different machines to minimize overall data movement, based on the "closest" execution environment (client or proxy) for each command and its file dependencies. 3. Automatically parallelizing pipelines that access many files while ensuring the output maintains a sequential execution order.</p><p>In order to address the challenge of understanding the semantics of shell command-line invocations, POSH uses annotations. POSH's key insight is that many shell applications only read and write to files specified in their command-line invocation, so POSH can deduce which files a command accesses from a model of the application's argument structure. Annotations store a model of each command's (e.g., cat's or grep's) semantics and arguments, stored locally at the client's shell. These annotations, inspired by recent proposals to annotate library function calls for automatic pipelining and parallelization <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, assign types to the possible arguments of command-line applications. At runtime, POSH can parse which arguments are files and use the underlying storage configuration to determine where those files are located.</p><p>Next, POSH must schedule the entire pipeline across the execution engine in a way that reduces data movement as much as possible. However, POSH does not know explicitly how much data is transferred across each pipe in the entire pipeline. If the output of grep or awk is piped to another command, POSH cannot know how much data will travel over the pipe without running the command. POSH constructs a DAG representation of the entire command and associated metadata and applies a greedy algorithm, that estimates how much data travels across each pipe, to determine the best way to schedule the DAG.</p><p>Finally, POSH further improves performance when it knows it can split commands into multiple data-parallel processes. POSH ensures that each split parallel invocation retains the same argument structure as the original command and that the output is stitched together in the correct order. It does so by using information about each argument stored in the annotation to safely split the command. POSH's execution engine serializes output from any parallel processes in the correct order, before writing to the final destination (e.g., client stdout).</p><p>This paper makes the following contributions:</p><p>1. An expressive annotation language for shell commands: Annotations capture the dominant grammar of most shell commands and summarize which inputs to command invocations are files as well as semantics to safely split command invocations across inputs.</p><p>2. A greedy scheduling algorithm that reduces data movement for unmodified shell pipelines: POSH's scheduling mechanism decides which parts of pipelines can be offloaded to proxy servers closer to the data and which parts of pipelines can be parallelized, while preserving the correctness of the output.</p><p>We evaluate POSH on a variety of workloads, including an image processing pipeline that creates thumbnails, a git command workflow on the Chromium repository, and log processing pipelines from research project analysis. On one hand, for a more compute-heavy log analysis application that includes a data transfer of one large file, POSH provides a 1.6× speedup over running bash over NFS. In the best case, for a git command workflow, POSH provides a 10-15× speedup over running bash over NFS, even when the client and the server are in the same datacenter. Section 8 contains the set of full results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Near-data computing (NDP). POSH draws upon previous work that "ships computation closer to the data." Previous approaches to NDP, surveyed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, focus on two paradigms: PIM (processing in-memory), where compute is co-located with memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>, or ISC (in-storage computing), where processors or accelerators are co-located with persistent memory or storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref>. POSH follows the second approach and pushes portions of arbitrary shell applications to proxy servers, compute units running on general-purpose servers, either co-located with storage devices or closer to storage devices than the client.</p><p>Barbalace et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> propose an entire operating system architecture for NDP with features such as locality-driven scheduling. Various systems focus on offloading database query computation into smart SSDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or FPGA accelerators <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref>. The Metal FS framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> allows users to run reusable compute kernels, that perform operations such as encryption or filtering, on FPGA accelerators near the storage. They can be programmed with standard shell syntax such as pipes to chain many near-data operations together. <ref type="bibr">Seshadri et al. [55]</ref> propose an extensible programmable SSD interface where users can push specific pieces of functionality, e.g., to run filesystem appends, to the SSD. Finally, many databases allow users to write SQL queries to run as stored procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>. Similarly, many key-value stores, such as Redis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, Splinter <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> and Comet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> support extensibility with user-defined functions. POSH, in contrast, focuses just on a locality-aware shell, to enable the extensibility of remote filesystems. POSH pushes computation to proxy servers (that do not require custom hardware), without forcing the user to explicitly decide which operations should be offloaded.</p><p>NFS Optimizations and filesystems. NFS, starting in version 4.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, offers support for some server-side operations, such as server-side copy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>; however, NFS does not have support for offloading arbitrary programs. NFS allows batching operations via compound operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>; Juszczak <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> describes techniques to batch writes. vNFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> offers a new API for NFS that supports batching and vectorizing filesystem operations. This technique reduces the latency of running commands such as tar over NFS, but still requires moving the data across the network, instead of pushing the computation to the data. CA-NFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> attempts to improve application per-formance in a multi-tenant scenario by adaptively scheduling certain client operations to run asynchronously during periods of high system load. POSH currently does not handle multitenancy, but could use similar methods to factor system load to adapt scheduling decisions. BlueSky <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> proposes running proxy servers in the cloud that serve data from slower blob storage; these proxy servers can expose NFS access to the data. POSH, in contrast, uses proxy servers to push application code.</p><p>Distributed execution engines. Distributed cluster computation systems such as Spark <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>, MapReduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Dryad [31]</ref>, Hadoop <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> also automatically parallelize computation on large datasets, but require that users follow a specific API. Systems such as gg <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and UCop <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> take "everyday applications," such as software compilation, unit testing and video encoding, and automatically parallelize them in the cloud. These systems focus on compute-intensive workloads, not I/O-intensive, and do not necessarily make decisions about scheduling computation to preserve data locality, unlike POSH.</p><p>Code offloading and type systems. Many systems enable code offloading, to implement distributed applications on many mobile devices that can benefit from computation on nearby servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Some of these systems require specific programming language constructs to offload processes and partition programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Recently, Pyxis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> optimizes database applications by automatically offloading procedures to run at the database server. It uses program analysis to determine what to offload, while POSH uses per-command annotations. Split Annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref> proposes using per-function annotations to determine how to split and pipeline function calls in data analytics workloads, to enable cross-function cache pipelining and parallelization. These annotations are fundamentally different from POSH's shell annotations: POSH's annotations attempt to understand the command-line semantics of shell commands, which tend to have a much more varied structure than function calls.</p><p>Command-line tools. Many command-line tools allow users to automatically parallelize and execute shell commands remotely. rsh <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> enables remote execution of shell commands. pssh <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> allows users to execute commands over SSH in parallel on other machines. GNU Parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> splits input arguments and executes jobs over these inputs in parallel across one or more machines. POSH also parallelizes commands on remote machines, but automatically decides how to offload and schedule commands so users do not need to explicitly program when to offload code. POSH does not rely on SSH access to the storage servers and can be used on top of a service such as NFS, where remote shell access may be prohibited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SYSTEM OVERVIEW</head><p>POSH consists of three main components: a shell annotation interface ( §4), a parser and scheduler ( §5), and an execution engine ( §6). This section briefly describes each component and how they link together, pictured in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Annotation interface. POSH, on bootup, requires users to provide a file containing a list of annotations for any commands they want POSH to consider offloading. Annotations are written once per command, e.g., once for grep or once for awk, so POSH can then accelerate shell pipelines that combine these commands with standard constructs, such as anonymous pipes. We envision that developers can share annotations for popular programs, so users do not necessarily need to write their own annotations; crowdsourcing annotations has seen success with TypeScript <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>.</p><p>Parser and scheduler. Given a shell program, the POSH parser turns each pipeline (each line of the program, potentially consisting of several commands combined by pipes and redirects) into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This graph represents the input-output relationship between commands, the standard I/O streams (stdin, stdout and stderr) and redirection targets, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. POSH then parses each individual command and its arguments using the corresponding annotation and completes the DAG by including additional input and output dependencies of the pipeline.</p><p>The parser finally runs a scheduling algorithm on the DAG and assigns an execution location to each command in the pipeline. In order to do this, the parser requires extra configuration information that specifies a mapping between each mounted client directory and the address for a machine running a proxy server for the corresponding directory (if any).</p><p>Execution engine. After POSH has parsed and scheduled a shell pipeline, it executes the command across the underlying execution engine. The execution engine consists of one or more proxy servers, each associated with a specific remote client mount, either at the storage server, or in a nearby node with access to the same data. Additionally, one "proxy server" runs at the client to execute any local computation. POSH ensures that the entire command looks like it has been running locally, even if processes had been offloaded to proxy servers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SHELL ANNOTATIONS</head><p>POSH must correctly understand the semantics of shell commands, which can be challenging because of the wide range of syntax allowed by command lines. In this section, we discuss the motivation and design of POSH's shell annotation layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Motivation for Shell Annotations</head><p>In order to schedule and execute shell pipelines in a way that minimizes data movement, POSH must understand the semantics of command-line pipelines. Concretely, annotations must reveal enough information that allows POSH to determine:</p><p>1. Which commands can be safely offloaded to proxy servers. 2. If any commands in the pipeline filter their input. 3. If any commands can be split in a data-parallel way into multiple processes.</p><p>Consider a simple pipeline: cat A B C D | grep "foo" | tee local_file.txt. POSH could try to offload any of the three commands: cat, grep, or tee. To determine which commands are safe to offload, POSH must understand which files (if any) cat, grep and tee access, and where these files live. Therefore, POSH must determine which arguments to the three commands represent file paths. However, outside of the program, all of these arguments are seen as generic strings. For example, consider the following four commands:</p><p>cat A B C D | grep "foo" tar -cvf output.tar.gz input/ tar -xvf input.tar.gz git status</p><p>The cat command takes in four input files, while the argument to grep is a string. The second command, tar -cvf, takes an output file argument followed by -f, followed by an input file argument (not preceded by a short option). The third command, also tar, takes an input file argument followed by -f and implicitly takes its output argument as the current directory. Finally, git also implicitly relies on the current directory as a dependency. Without a formal way to model the argument structure for each command, POSH could not determine the file dependencies for each command.</p><p>Secondly, in order to produce an execution schedule that reduces data movement, POSH needs to know the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a command. In the cat | grep example, if the file argument to cat is remote, to minimize data movement, POSH cannot just offload the cat command. Since cat usually produces the same amount of output as input, but grep usually filters its input, POSH must also offload grep.</p><p>Finally, suppose cat had multiple file arguments, but these files lived on different mounts (e.g., a pipeline that processes logs from different servers). POSH could not safely offload this command to a single proxy server, as the proxy server may not have access to all the mounts. However, many command-line programs perform map functions over each line in the file in sequence. For example, cat prints all lines to the output, and grep filters the input line by line. Therefore, these commands can be split into processes across their input files and then offloaded to different proxy servers. However, parallelization is not safe for all commands: wc, for example, "reduces" the input. Without a formal model for the command's semantics, POSH could not make optimal scheduling decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Annotation Interface</head><p>Annotations need enough information to allow POSH to deconstruct, parse and schedule each command. Annotations contain two types of information: argument-specific and command-specific information. First, they contain a list of arguments along with a type assignment for each argument. Second, they contain information relevant to parsing the entire command line, either semantic information relevant to scheduling, or custom parsing options. The annotation interface is inspired by the POSIX conventions for command-line arguments and their GNU extensions [23], which are followed by a multitude of UNIX utilities. If a program does not follow these conventions, POSH may not be able to determine how to accelerate it. We describe both parts of the annotation in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Argument-Specific Information</head><p>POSH supports the following classes of command-line arguments:</p><p>1. A single option with no arguments (e.g., -d or --debug). 2. An option, followed by one or more parameters (e.g. -f &lt;file&gt;).</p><p>3. A parameter without a preceding option (e.g. the arguments in cat A B C D).</p><p>The annotations must specify the following information for each argument that has associated parameters:</p><p>1. The short or long option name: This is only relevant for arguments preceded by options. 2. The type: input_file, output_file, or string. 3. The size: 1, specific_size(x), or list (for variable size). 4. If the argument is splittable: If an argument has multiple parameters, the splittable keyword specifies that the command can be split in a data-parallel way across this argument (this is only allowed for up to a single argument).</p><p>The above format applies to many popular UNIX commands and core utilities. For example, the annotation for cat may look like:</p><p>cat: -PARAMS: -type:input_file,splittable,size:list</p><p>This specifies that cat takes in one or more input files, and it can be split across its inputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Command-Specific Information</head><p>Annotations contain information relevant to the semantics of the entire command, specified by the following keywords:</p><p>• needs_current_dir: Whether the command implicitly relies on the current directory.</p><p>• splittable_across_input: Whether the command can be split across its standard input. In the example pipeline, if the cat is split into separate cats, POSH would also need to split the grep command into separate commands to truly take advantage of parallelism.</p><p>• filters_input: Whether the command is likely to have a smaller output than input.</p><p>• long_arg_single_dash: Most programs use double dashes before long arguments (e.g. --debug), but some programs require long arguments be preceded by a single dash. (e.g. -debug).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Annotation Conflicts</head><p>Some commands can be invoked with flags whose behavior changes depending on which other flags are present. For example, the annotation for a tar invocation used to create an archive could be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">tar: [filters_input] -FLAGS: -short:c -short:z -OPTPARAMS:</formula><p>-short:f,type:output_file,size:1 -PARAMS:</p><p>-type:input_file,size:list However, developers commonly invoke both tar -x and tar -c, to extract and create a tarball, respectively. The assignment for the -f flag conflicts; it would be an input_file in the -x case, but an output_file in the -c case. POSH supports this by allowing multiple annotations per command. In particular, a client can include one annotation per type of invocation for every binary, and POSH will try all annotations until it finds one that fits the current invocation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Correctness and Coverage</head><p>Potential mistakes. POSH depends on correct annotations for optimal execution: if the annotations are incorrect in some way, POSH does not make guarantees about the correctness or the performance of the resulting execution. Annotations with incorrect type semantics (assigning an argument with str instead of input_file) or parallelization semantics (specifying a command is splittable when the command needs all input files concurrently) could cause execution errors. POSH might schedule the command on a machine without access to a necessary file, or incorrectly try to split the command into parallel workers. Annotations might not include potential optimization information, by omitting that a command filters its input or it can be parallelized. In this case POSH might not make the optimal scheduling decision, but execution will still be correct. Finally, a command, such as awk, could either filter or increase its input depending on its invocation. awk could include multiple annotations for each separate program string, which separately specify or omit the filters_input keyword.</p><p>Mitigations. In practice, we expect that a community of developers would maintain and crowdsource a set of "verified" annotations; other annotation-based systems such as Typescript <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> make this assumption. To prevent incorrect type semantics, POSH could use a sandbox on top of the filesystem interface that checks if the program only reads and writes to files specified by the annotation, and crash the execution if the program accesses a file outside of its dependency list <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Finally, future work could explore profiling commands to automatically deduce whether command invocations produce less, more or the same amount of input data as output data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">POSH's PARSER AND SCHEDULER</head><p>This section discusses how POSH solves two challenges in executing shell commands efficiently across a set of proxy servers: (1) scheduling pipelines to minimize data movement ( §5.2) and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>  effectively solve these two problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">POSH's Program Representation</head><p>POSH needs a program representation that allows the runtime to see every data source (file that is read), data sink (output file that is written to), and flow (pipe) that connects two commands within the pipeline. Understanding which files commands read and write allows POSH to determine the execution location closest to the data for each command. Understanding the connections in the pipeline allows POSH to see how data flows between commands and allows POSH to preserve dependencies when parallelizing nodes. POSH represents parsed shell pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which contain nodes and streams. Nodes represent single commands (command nodes) along with each of their arguments, and parsed annotation metadata (argument types, if it is splittable, and if it filters its input). Nodes also represent sources and sinks in the entire pipeline: reading from stdin (read nodes) or writing to stdout or a file (write nodes). Streams represent the data flows in and out of these nodes.</p><p>Given a shell pipeline, POSH constructs a DAG that models the dependencies between commands (UNIX pipes) and standard I/O streams (stdin, stdout and stderr). POSH then builds a custom argument parser for each command from the annotations, to determine which arguments actually appear in each command's invocation and what their corresponding types are. For example, if a tar -c invocation contained the -f argument, POSH knows the string following -f is an output_file. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows an example DAG generated for the simple program discussed in §4.1, that runs cat and grep on files stored in different mounts and pipes the final output to tee. for node ∈ dag.GETNODES do node.location ← CLIENT POSH schedules and parallelizes the workload by first splitting the command into separate cat and grep commands that run at each proxy server and then merging the outputs at the client. Sections 5.2 and 5.3 discuss these steps in turn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Scheduling</head><p>POSH's scheduling algorithm seeks to minimize data movement, as it assumes that in scenarios where the computation is I/O bound rather than CPU bound, minimizing data movement will reduce end-to-end latency. However, POSH does not know how much data a command will produce prior to execution. We describe the exact setup of the problem and POSH's greedy algorithm that uses information from POSH's annotations to estimate how to minimize data movement.</p><p>Problem setup. The POSH scheduling algorithm, summarized in Algorithm 1, takes the DAG representation of the command discussed in §5.1 and assigns an execution location to each node. POSH must pay attention to two concerns: constraints on where certain nodes can execute and the number of bytes transferred across edges in the DAG. The first concern arises because certain proxy servers might not be able to execute certain nodes as they do not have access to all the necessary files. The second concern arises because POSH seeks to minimize the number of bytes transferred between two locations across the network. Concretely, consider a cat node (operating on a remote file) that pipes its output to a grep node, that filters for file ∈ GETFILEDEPENDENCIES(node) do <ref type="bibr">11:</ref> deps.append(GETLOCATION(file)) <ref type="bibr">12:</ref> if deps.length() &gt; 1 then while node.children.length() &gt; 0 do <ref type="bibr">21:</ref> path.append(GETSTDOUT(node)) <ref type="bibr">22:</ref> return path its input, which in turn writes its output to stdout on the client. To schedule the least data movement across the network, POSH should offload both the cat and grep commands: in the path through the cat, grep and the stdout nodes, the minimum cut (edge with least data transferred) occurs after grep.</p><p>Step 1: Resolving constraints on each node. Algorithm 2 summarizes the helper functions for the scheduling algorithm, including a function, Constraint, that determines whether a node in the DAG has any constraints on execution location (lines 1-16). Read and write nodes are assigned to the location of their input or output data streams (lines 4-7). Command nodes that access files on a single mount are greedily assigned to execute on the proxy server corresponding to that mount (lines 14-15). Finally, command nodes that access files from multiple different mounts are always assigned to execute on the client (lines 12-13). Only the client has access to all mounts; by default, proxy servers only serve requests for a single mount. We discuss an optimization to this decision in §5.3, for special cases where the command can be parallelized.</p><p>Step 2: Minimizing data transfer. In Algorithm 1, after assigning locations to nodes with constraints (lines 1-4), POSH assigns locations for the remaining command nodes. POSH first iterates through all the source nodes of the graph, traces the path from each source to a sink node with the GetPathToSink helper function defined in lines 18-19 of Algorithm 2, and considers each path individually. Each path is guaranteed to be linear because each node in the graph effectively has one child. POSH assumes most data transfer occurs along stdout streams: even though command nodes have two children (one edge to stdout and one to stderr), POSH only pays attention to stdout connections. Read nodes can have one child by definition, and write nodes are sinks, so have no children. Within a path, when the source and sink nodes have the same location, scheduling is simple: all nodes along the path from the source to the sink are assigned that location (lines 8-11). However, when the source and sink have different locations, the scheduler must find the edge along which cross-location data transfer should occur: to minimize data transfer, this should be the edge where the least data flows. POSH first iterates along each edge in a path and assigns relative weights according to heuristics (lines 13-18). POSH assumes nodes produce the same amount of output as input, or filters input by half (lines 16-18). The helper function IsFilterNode called on line 16 returns true for commands whose annotations indicate that they filter their input from the filters_input keyword. This heuristic, that filter commands halve their input, obviously does not fit all cases. Some filters, such as wc, usually produce much less than half the input. To find the minimum cut, only the relative ordering of edges matters, rather than the absolute weight values.</p><p>POSH then iterates along each path and schedules each unassigned node's location to be either the source location or the sink location, depending on if the node is before or after the minimum cut edge. For example, if a path contains cat, grep, and cut, and writes to stdout on the client, POSH determines the minimum weight edge is in between cut and the stdout write node. When there are conflicting assignments from nodes appearing in two different paths, POSH schedules the node on the client (lines 25-26).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Parallelization</head><p>The second challenge POSH resolves is determining when commands are safe to parallelize and then guaranteeing correct execution while parallelizing nodes. After determining a command is safe to split, correctly executing the command in a data-parallel way requires: (1) splitting the command only across the argument that can be split while preserving the other arguments and (2) stitching the outputs of the command back together in the correct order.</p><p>Determining which nodes to parallelize. POSH can automatically parallelize nodes that are safe to parallelize across the files they access, or across their input edges. In the first case, to parallelize the command cat -n A.txt B.txt C.txt, POSH needs to know that the file arguments are A.txt, B.txt and C.txt, and that the "-n" flag must be preserved. POSH uses the per-argument splittable keyword in an annotation, which indicates that the command can be split across a particular argument (here, the file argument). In the above example, POSH would replace the single node for cat with three nodes, each with the -n flag and one of A.txt, B.txt or C.txt.</p><p>In the second case, POSH allows nodes to also be parallelized across their input streams. Concretely, if the cat above piped its output to grep, there would not be much performance benefit to parallelizing cat, unless POSH also split grep across the three input cat nodes. POSH determines which commands this parallelization is safe for via the splittable_across_input keyword. The annotation for grep would include this keyword, so POSH would replace the grep node with three grep nodes for each cat node. This is not safe for commands that reduce or merge the input such as word count (wc): since the annotation for wc would not include this keyword, POSH would ensure that the output of the prior commands are merged before executing wc.</p><p>Splitting across mounts. When POSH splits nodes that can be parallelized, it will inherently split commands that read and write to different mounts. This allows the scheduler to bypass the restriction in Algorithm 2, lines 12-13. If a single command accesses files in different mounts, but the command can be split, instead of assigning this node to run at the client, POSH will split it into multiple workers that run in parallel on different proxies. POSH by default parallelizes commands across machines, but within a single machine, the maximum splitting factor parameter determines the degree to which to split further. The default value is 1, but increasing the splitting factor to a value &gt; 1 causes POSH to split a command into 񮽙 commands that each operate on 񮽙 񮽙 sized chunks of the input files, where 񮽙 is the number of files that the node accesses on a single machine.</p><p>Correctly preserving output order. In order to ensure that the output of the entire pipeline is correct, when POSH splits a command in parallel, it must ensure that any node that reads the output of this node now reads the output of the replacement nodes in sequence. When nodes execute, they process their inputs in sequential order, guaranteeing correct output order.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">POSH CONFIGURATION AND EXECUTION</head><p>In this section, we discuss how to configure POSH and how POSH executes programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">POSH Configuration</head><p>To understand how to setup and configure POSH, consider a client that has access to folders on two NFS servers, within a nearby datacenter. Each NFS administrator has agreed to allow a separate proxy server, that resides within the same datacenter, to access the same mounts on behalf of the client (via NFS). 1 To use POSH, each of the two proxy servers must run the POSH server program, which is configured with a list of client credentials mapped to the folder paths each client has access to (which the proxy servers themselves access via NFS). The client must run the POSH client program, which takes in a file containing the shell annotations, and a configuration file that specifies a mapping from locally mounted folders, to the addresses for proxy servers for those mounts. In the previous example, the client's configuration file would map each of the two mounted folders to the corresponding proxy server. Together, the client and the two proxy servers make up POSH's execution engine, which can be used to execute any schedules POSH's parser creates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Execution Engine</head><p>After the client schedules a shell pipeline, the execution engine can execute the DAG.</p><p>Setup Phase. First, the client divides the DAG into subgraphs that need to execute on different machines (including a subgraph that will execute on the client itself). The client handles setting up persistent connections with proxy servers for any pipes between DAG nodes assigned to two different machines. Finally, when all pipes are setup, the client sends a request to each proxy server to start executing their portion of the DAG.</p><p>Execution Phase. Once each proxy server receives a request to execute a subprogram DAG, it will first spawn all the nodes in the DAG corresponding to processes that need to be executed (e.g., cat or grep). To redirect I/O between processes, POSH spawns a thread for each redirection that needs to occur and copies the output from each node to the correct pipe, TCP stream or file. For nodes that have multiple inputs, nodes process these inputs sequentially. Nodes that send output to nodes with multiple inputs buffer the content until the receiver starts processing that node's output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Implementation</head><p>POSH is implemented in about 12,400 lines of Rust code. POSH uses Rust's CLAP library <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref> to build custom parsers for each command, based on the command's annotation, to find out which arguments are actually present in an invocation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">METHODOLOGY</head><p>We evaluate POSH by measuring its performance impact over five unmodified I/O-intensive shell applications. This section describes our evaluation methodology: the applications, why they cover a broad range of I/O-intensive shell applications, and our experimental setups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Applications</head><p>For each application, in our evaluation setting, we assume that all input data files and intermediate files live on a remote NFS mount, so POSH accelerates these applications by preventing unnecessary data movement. Some applications require writing the final output to stdout or a file on the client; we specify this on a per-application basis.</p><p>Ray-tracing log analysis. The first application represents a best-case workload for POSH: it is computationally light, can be parallelized, and its output is a tiny fraction of the data it reads. The application analyzes logs of a massively distributed research ray-tracing (computer graphics) system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, to track a task (a simulated ray of light) through the path of workers it traversed. The analysis first cleans and aggregates each worker's log into one file with cat, grep, head and cut. It then runs sed to search for the path of a single ray (e.g., a straggler) across all the workers and stores the final output on a file at the client.</p><p>Thumbnail generation. The next application is CPUintensive, but still produces output that is a tiny fraction of its input, and is highly parallelizable. The application uses ImageMagick <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> to generate thumbnails of size 10 KB for each image in a folder of about 1090 images, each about 4 MB large; the output thumbnails are also written to the remote mount.</p><p>Port scan analysis. The third application is computationally heavy, but not parallelizable, and involves data transfers of large files. ZMap <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is a network scanning tool that performs Internet-wide scans of the public IPv4 address space. Network security researchers run the following shell application to analyze 40 GB subset of a full Internet scan of port 80; the final output file is stored in the remote mount.</p><p>1. Clean the raw data with a program called zannotate.</p><p>2. Use a JSON processing tool, jq, to isolate the IP and AS ID# (Autonomous System ID) columns. 3. Use pr to merge the columns together. 4. Use awk to count the number of IPs per AS.</p><p>Distributed log analysis. The next application is a synthetic benchmark that models system administrators running analysis on logs across different storage servers, to search for an IP address within the access logs stored across different machines. It is computationally light, highly parallelizable, and the output is a tiny fraction of the input. This workload runs cat over all of the files and then filters for a particular IP with grep and writes the results back to the file stored locally at the client. Each of five storage servers contains approximately 15 GB of logs from the SEC's EDGAR Log File Data Set <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Git workflow. The final application, a git pipeline on the Chromium <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> repository, attempts to imitate a developer's git workflow and is extremely metadata-heavy. After rolling back the repository by 20 commits and saving each commit's patch, the workload successively applies each patch and runs three git commands: git status, git add ., and git commit -m.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">EVALUATION</head><p>Our evaluation seeks to answer several questions: (1) Can POSH accelerate end-to-end pipelines that use many different command-line tools to access remote data over NFS ( §8.1)?</p><p>(2) What is the best way to configure POSH ( §8.2)? (3) Where do performance benefits come from ( §8.3)?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">End-to-End Application Performance</head><p>For each workload described in §7.1, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figures 3 and 4</ref> show the performance of POSH compared to bash over NFS for two network settings: one where the client is in the same GCP region as the storage server ("cloud") and one where the client is in a university network outside the datacenter ("university"). For git, <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> only shows results for a client in the same datacenter.</p><p>Summary of all results. On the university-to-cloud network, POSH performs 8× better than bash over NFS on the ray-tracing workload, 1-2× better on the thumbnail generation and port scan analysis workloads, and 12.7× better on the distributed log analysis workload. On the cloud-to-cloud network, POSH outperforms bash over NFS for the git workload and distributed log analysis workload; however, POSH does not outperform bash over NFS on the other three applications, partially because these applications are more bandwidth than latency sensitive. We discuss each set of applications below.</p><p>Ray-tracing log analysis. This workload sees an 8× improvement on the university-to-cloud network and no improvement on the cloud-to-cloud network. The workload reads 6 GB of input from about 2000 files over NFS, and aggregates them into one 4 GB file, which is written back to NFS. The final output of sed on the aggregated file is much smaller (20 lines). POSH prevents 10 GB of data from being copied across the network unnecessarily. On the cloud-to-cloud network, both the overheads of separate filesystem requests (to open and read 2000 files) and the overheads of transferring data to the client are not as large.</p><p>Thumbnail generation.

The POSH proxy runs directly on the NFS server. POSH provides between 1.6-12.7× speedups in the university-to-cloud network compared to NFS. Using POSH from a client outside the datacenter results in about same latency as a client inside the datacenter using NFS, with barely any overhead over local execution.</p><p>• • posh nfs−sync nfs−async local <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Average latency of 20 git status, git add, and git commit commands run on Chromium repo, of POSH compared to NFS and local execution, for a client in the same cloud datacenter as the storage server.

Generating thumbnails with ImageMagick is computationally heavy: it takes 12 minutes to finish when running locally. While generating thumbnails produces a smaller input (12 MB of thumbnails vs. 15 GB of input images), in the cloud network, transferring 15 GB of data to the client will take about 12 seconds on a 10 Gbps connection.

The scanning analysis workload sees a 1.6× benefit with POSH in the university-to-cloud setting, but no benefit in the cloud-to-cloud setting. The scanning workload starts by processing one large 40 GB file with zannotate and writing the result back to NFS. This is more bandwidth than latency sensitive, as the application makes fewer filesystem requests across the network than the ray-tracing or thumbnail generation workloads. In addition, zannotate is CPU-intensive as it must parse each line of JSON in the input file.</p><p>Distributed log analysis. This workload sees a 12.7× improvement in the university-to-cloud setting, because POSH is able to parallelize the computation across the five different mounts and only aggregate the result locally. Both offloading the computation in order to prevent data movement as well as running the work on each machine in parallel, instead of sequentially, reduces latency. Even in the cloud-to-cloud setting, this results in a 2× speedup.</p><p>Git workflow. POSH sees the greatest performance benefit, a 10-15× latency improvement, when running git commands over NFS. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the time for each git status, git add, and git commit commands for 20 commits, in the cloud-to-cloud network. We did not perform this full analysis for the university-to-cloud network, because the time to run a single add was up to two hours. git repositories typically contain many small files; commands like status and add check the status of every file in the folders to see if it has been modified. This results in NFS making filesystem requests such as stat for every file. As a comparison, the ray-tracing log analysis workload makes around 2,500 open() calls and 2,500 stat() class. For a git add in this workload, these numbers are 34,000 and 340,000, respectively, measured by strace. By offloading these commands to the server, POSH avoids many unnecessary roundtrips.</p></div>

However, in this setting, the proxy server will have at least the same latency as bash over NFS for the cloud-to-cloud setting. The proxy still must perform remote filesystem requests and transfer all the necessary data within the datacenter, because it mounts the data over NFS as well. bash over NFS does not have much overhead for the ray-tracing and thumbnail generation workloads, but has a 10-15× overhead for the git workload, due to many filesystem metadata calls. However, running git at the client outside the datacenter over NFS would have taken on the order of hours; POSH merely takes seconds.</p></div>

Consider a command such as comm, that finds the common lines between two files on different mounts: POSH would schedule this command to run at the client, causing no performance benefits over bash over NFS. However, if POSH scheduled this command on one of the proxy servers, rather than the client, and transferred the necessary files beforehand, POSH could provide a benefit over NFS. To produce such a schedule, POSH could consider the input files for each command, the data transfer speeds between the proxy machines and the dependencies of the DAG to construct an optimization problem and use standard graph partitioning techniques to solve for the optimal execution location of all nodes. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows the expected benefits of a such a scheduler ("POSH-OPT"), for a comm command that correlates two 3 GB files stored at two different proxies.

To mitigate this, POSH could ensure that offloaded programs run with limited file access permissions, so they do not access restricted files, and only access files that are specified by the input and output arguments parsed from the annotations.

Since POSH proxy servers could run directly at the storage server, a shared storage server could result in an overloaded CPU and longer latencies for users who expected their commands to take less time since they were offloaded, as well as slowdowns to regular remote filesystem requests. POSH does not currently have policies for load balancing and multitenancy, but could explore policies suggested by prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, initial experiments show that POSH could use a simple policy on the storage server such as monitoring how many cores are in use, and refusing to run programs at the storage server when it is overloaded.</p><p>Failure recovery. Currently, POSH does not recover from server-side failures; it does not have mechanisms to migrate or restart jobs if single commands within pipelines fail.</p><p>Since POSH aims to provide shell semantics, which involves streaming data without providing fault tolerance for failed commands, POSH currently does not provide the fault tolerance mechanisms present in standard cluster computing frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61]</ref>. However, this is an interesting area of future work: POSH knows exactly what files are being modified or created from the annotations, so POSH could modify programs to write to temporary locations, and only write to the final location when the entire operation is successful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">CONCLUSION</head><p>I/O-intensive shell pipelines that run over networked storage incur a significant cost from moving data over the network. We present POSH, a framework that accelerates unmodified shell pipelines with I/O heavy components that access networked storage such as NFS. POSH intercepts shell pipelines and moves individual commands closer to the data by offloading them to run on proxy servers closer to the data than the client. POSH uses metadata about shell commands, written once per command, called annotations, that specify information relevant to safely offloading these commands to proxy servers as well as scheduling them to minimize data movement. POSH uses annotations to schedule and automatically parallelize shell pipelines across the client and proxy servers, while maintaining local execution semantics. We showed that POSH can accelerate a wide range of unmodified shell applications running over NFS and allow them to achieve local execution times.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: In POSH's main workflow, a shell command is passed to the parser, which uses the annotations to generate and schedule a DAG representation of the command.
