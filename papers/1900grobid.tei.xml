				<p>Data centers are evolving to host heterogeneous work-loads on shared clusters to reduce the operational cost and achieve higher resource utilization. However, it is challenging to schedule heterogeneous workloads with diverse resource requirements and QoS constraints. On the one hand, latency-critical jobs need to be scheduled as soon as they are submitted to avoid any queuing delays. On the other hand, best-effort long jobs should be allowed to occupy the cluster when there are idle resources to improve cluster utilization. The challenge lies in how to minimize the queuing delays of short jobs while maximizing cluster utilization. Existing solutions either forcibly kill long jobs to guarantee low latency for short jobs or disable preemption to optimize utilization. Hybrid approaches with resource reservations have been proposed but need to be tuned for specific workloads. In this paper, we propose and develop BIG-C, a container-based resource management framework for Big Data cluster computing. The key design is to leverage lightweight virtualization, a.k.a, containers to make tasks preemptable in cluster scheduling. We devise two types of preemption strategies: immediate and graceful preemptions and show their effectiveness and trade-offs with loosely-coupled MapReduce workloads as well as iterative, in-memory Spark workloads. Based on the mechanisms for task preemption, we further develop a preemptive fair share cluster scheduler. We have implemented BIG-C in YARN. Our evaluation with synthetic and production workloads shows that low-latency and high utilization can be both attained when scheduling heterogeneous workloads on a contended cluster.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Recently, the proliferation of data-intensive cluster applications, such as data mining, data analytics, scientific computation, and web search has led to the development of datacenter-scale computing. Resource efficiency is a critical issue when operating such datacenters at scale.</p><p>Studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> have shown that increasing utilization by sharing the hardware infrastructure among multiple users leads to superior resource and energy efficiencies. Therefore, cluster management frameworks, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> face the challenges of efficiently hosting a variety of heterogeneous workloads with diverse QoS requirements and resource demands.</p><p>Short jobs have stringent latency requirements and are sensitive to scheduling delays while long jobs can tolerate long latency but have higher requirements for the quality of scheduling, e.g., preserving data locality. To reconcile the conflicting objectives, recent proposed schedulers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> reserve a portion of the cluster to run exclusively short jobs using distributed scheduling while long jobs are scheduled onto the unreserved portion using centralized scheduling. The challenge is to determine the optimal partition of the cluster to guarantee low latency to short jobs while maintaining high cluster utilization, under highly dynamic workloads.</p><p>We look at the cluster scheduling problem from a different angle -if tasks from short jobs can preempt any long tasks, their scheduling can be made simple and fast while long jobs can run on any server in the cluster to maintain high utilization. Unfortunately, existing cluster schedulers do not support efficient task preemption. For example, YARN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Mesos <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> only support killbased preemption and killed tasks need to be restarted. This could lead to substantial slowdown to long-running jobs due to the loss of execution progress.</p><p>In this paper, we leverage application containers, a form of lightweight virtualization, to enable preemptive and low latency scheduling in clusters with heterogeneous workloads. Although containers, such as Docker, are being increasingly adopted in distributed systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, their usage is primarily for agile application deployment, leaving much of containers' potential in resource management unexploited. We explore the flexible resource management provided by container virtualization to enable low-cost task preemp-tion. Specifically, tasks encapsulated in containers can be suspended by depriving the resources allocated to their containers and resumed later by replenishing the resources. Based on this preemption mechanism, we propose and develop BIG-C, a Container-based resource management framework for BIG data analytics that provides low-latency scheduling to preempting jobs while minimizing performance penalty to preempted jobs.</p><p>BIG-C uses Docker <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to containerize tasks and relies on Linux cgroups to precisely control the CPU and memory allocations to such containers. In BIG-C, long jobs are immediately preempted upon the arrival of short jobs to guarantee low latency. We devise two types of preemptions: immediate and graceful preemptions. Immediate preemption instantaneously reduces the resources of the preempted task to a minimum footprint while still keeping the task alive to the task management. Graceful preemption gradually takes resources away from long tasks, minimizing long job slowdown. The two container-based preemption schemes replace the kill-based task preemption and can be seamlessly integrated into any fair sharing cluster schedulers and are transparent to applications. In BIG-C, we integrate the two preemption schemes into a preemptive fair share scheduler based on YARN's capacity scheduler.</p><p>We have implemented BIG-C on Apache YARN and evaluated it on a 26-node cluster using heterogeneous workloads composed of TPC-H queries and batch jobs from HiBench <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Experimental results show that BIG-C strikes a balance between short job latency and cluster utilization compared with state-of-the-art schedulers. The source code of BIG-C is publicly available 1 .</p><p>Our results also provide insights on serving heterogeneous workloads in MapReduce and Spark. Immediate preemption works generally well for MapReduce jobs: (1) tasks are loosely coupled and the preemption of some tasks does not impede the progress of other tasks; (2) tasks have dedicated containers and their intermediate results are periodically persisted to disk, making it faster to reclaim their memory when preempted. In contrast, immediate preemption incurs significant performance loss to jobs in Spark: (1) Spark executors employ a multi-threaded model and the preemption of one container affects multiple tasks; (2) for Spark jobs with iterative computation, tasks involve in frequent synchronization between each other within and across executors/-containers; (3) due to in-memory processing, reclaiming memory from preempted containers may incur significant memory swapping. We find that graceful preemption is more suitable for Spark workloads.  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Real-world Trace Analysis</head><p>To understand job characteristics and resource usage of production workloads, we analyze the publicly available traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> from Google data centers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1(a)</ref> shows that short jobs that complete within 1 minute dominate the traces and contribute to 80% of the total number of jobs. Although data center workloads mostly consist of short jobs, long jobs account for most resource usage. It has been reported by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> that the top 10% long jobs, which are only responsible for 28% of the total number of tasks, account for more than 80% of the total task execution time. According to the analysis, there is a difficult tradeoff in data center scheduling: short jobs are sensitive to delays and critical to QoS enforcements while long jobs are important to maintaining high resource utilization. Existing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> shows that prioritizing short jobs and serving long jobs in a best-effort manner on a shared infrastructure meet both requirements.</p><p>When resources are contended, both prioritization and the enforcement of fair sharing can lead to the preemption of already running tasks. Preempted tasks are often evicted or killed. Figure 1(b) plots task submission and eviction rates in the Google trace for a period of 48 hours. According to Google, a task can be evicted by higher priority tasks in the case of resource shortage or stopped if the task owner user/group exceeds its fair share of cluster resources. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>(b) shows that task eviction rate climbs up as submission rate increases, indicating a clear relationship between task preemptions and resource contention. In the 48-hour period, there were 910,099 tasks submitted, of which 93,714 were evicted and most of them were long jobs. As discussed above, long jobs account for a disproportionate amount of resource usage. The evictions of long jobs are especially expensive as the loss of their execution progress translates to significant resource waste. While evicted jobs can be relaunched when there are sufficient resources, the eviction can also add substantial delay to the completion time of such jobs. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Overhead of Kill-based Preemption</head><p>Task killing is a simple means to realize preemption. However, killed tasks cannot be resumed and have to be relaunched. Most cluster schedulers use this approach due to its simplicity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the overhead of kill-based preemption for different types of MapReduce and Spark jobs. We configured long jobs to fully utilize a 26-node YARN cluster. Detailed configuration of the cluster can be found in §5.1. During the execution of each long job, we injected a 6-minute burst of short Spark-SQL queries. The YARN default capacity scheduler was set to assign a share of 95% cluster resources to Spark-SQL queries, enforcing a strictly higher priority for the short jobs. Upon the arrival of short jobs, YARN kills tasks selected randomly from the long job to free resources needed by short jobs. Killed tasks are immediately resubmitted to YARN for rescheduling.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, MapReduce jobs suffer less performance penalty from task killing than Spark jobs do. Task killing degraded the overall performance of MapReduce jobs by 8% -64% while incurring as much as 92% overhead to Spark jobs. Among MapReduce jobs, those are dominated by the map phase, e.g., wordcount, suffered marginal degradation compared to the noticeable slowdown experienced by reduce-heavy jobs, e.g., terasort. Because mappers are usually small and independent from each other, the termination of a few mappers does not lead to much computation loss nor significantly delay job completion. In contrast, reducers require all-to-all communications with mappers. This data shuffling phase runs much longer than mappers. Therefore, the killing of one reducer requires the lengthy and resource intensive shuffling process to be restarted, which substantially delays job completion.</p><p>Spark jobs are more susceptible to delays due to task killings for the following reasons. First, Spark jobs, especially machine learning algorithms that iterate over a data set, require frequent synchronizations between tasks. If one task is killed, other dependent tasks are unable to make any progress. Second, Spark in-memory processing does not persist intermediate results to storage. For jobs with multiple stages, the killing of one task could lead to the re-computation of dependent stages. This recovery process is usually quite expensive. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 2</ref> shows that Spark jobs suffered on average 70% slowdown when interrupted by the burst of short jobs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Container-based Task Preemption</head><p>In this section, we present two simple container-based approaches for task preemption and in the next section we integrate them into cluster scheduling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Container-based Virtualization</head><p>Container-based virtualization, such as Docker, has gained popularity due to its almost negligible overhead compared to hypervisor-based virtualization. A container provides isolated namespaces for applications running inside the container and forms a resource accounting and allocation unit. Linux uses control groups (cgroups) to precisely control the resource allocation to a container. Not only priorities can be set to reflect the relative importance of containers, hard resource limits guarantee that containers consume resources no more than a predefined upper bound even there are available resources in the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Immediate Task Preemption</head><p>We leverage the flexible resource allocation enabled by containers to temporarily suspend a task in Big Data analytics and reclaim its resources without losing the execution progress. We assume that each task is encapsulated into a container 2 . Each container forms a cgroup and is configured with two types of resources: CPU and memory. Parameter cpuset.cpus controls the number of CPU cores that a container can use and parameter memory.limit in bytes limits the maximum memory usage. cpu.cfs quota us and cpu.cfs period us together determine the maximum CPU allocation to a container. This enables fine-grained control of CPU cycles beyond allocating CPU cores. Task suspension involves two steps: stop task execution and save task context. To stop a task, the host container is deprived of CPU to stop task execution. To save the task's context for later resumption, its dirty data in memory needs to be written back to disk. Fortunately, no additional effort is needed to support context saving. When reclaiming a container's memory, the virtual memory management in the host operating system (OS) writes back dirty data. For fault tolerance, cluster schedulers monitor the progress of individual tasks and launch speculative tasks if stragglers are detected.</p><p>The suspension of containers will falsely trigger the failover. To avoid extensive changes to cluster schedulers to support task preemption, we suspend a task but maintain a minimal footprint for the task to keep it alive to the cluster scheduler. We empirically set the minimal container footprint to 1% CPU and 64 MB memory, with which the thread responsible for sending the heartbeat in the container still appears to be alive to the scheduler. We also disable speculative execution for suspended tasks. Task resumption is simply re-activating the container by restoring its deprived resources. The resumption also follows two steps. The memory size of the container is restored from the minimal footprint back to its original size and the CPU limit is lifted. We call this type of preemption, which reclaims and restores all resources of a preempted task in one pass, immediate preemption (IP). Overhead of immediate preemption Despite that killbased preemption is crude, it guarantees timely scheduling of short jobs. The container-based immediate preemption, however, can possibly delay short job scheduling and inflict performance degradation to long jobs. First, it may take non-negligible time to reclaim the memory of preempted tasks before short tasks can be scheduled, depending on the working set size of preempted tasks. Second, task resumption requires loading saved context into memory. For certain jobs, this process is particularly long. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref> shows the memory swapping activities when a 1 GB container was suspended to the minimal footprint and later resumed. The container ran a multi-threaded synthetic Java benchmark that repeatedly and randomly touched a 1 GB array. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>(a) shows that it took 3 seconds (between the 40 th and 45 th seconds) to reclaim nearly 1 GB memory. Note that the swapping activities lasted much longer until the container was deprived of CPU at the 130 th second. It took even longer to load saved context into memory after the container was resumed at the 230 th second. The reason is that the multiple threads in the container simultaneously loaded their working sets when memory was restored, resulting in a large volume of random disk access. The synthetic benchmark provides following insights on IP overhead:</p><p>• It is expensive to reclaim memory from a container that is actively dirtying its working set.</p><p>• Depriving CPU effectively throttles disk reads during memory reclaiming, shortening the suspension delay.</p><p>• Spark jobs are particularly susceptible to the resumption overhead when multiple tasks from an/a executor/container are activated to simultaneously load their working sets from disk.</p><p>To reduce the overhead, one optimization is to first reclaim CPU from a container to throttle task activity before memory is reclaimed. However, this optimization is not sufficient to guarantee short job latency or minimize long job degradation, which motivated us to develop the graceful preemption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Graceful Task Preemption</head><p>While immediate preemption deprives a task of all resources to completely suspend the task, graceful preemption (GP) shrinks a preempted task and reclaims its resources in multiple rounds. Compared to immediate preemption, graceful preemption reclaims a task's resources at a pre-defined step ~ r = (c, m), where c and m are the unit resource reclamation for CPU cores and memory, respectively. GP is based on the following insights:</p><p>• Tasks from long jobs are usually larger than tasks from short jobs. Launching a short task often does not need to reclaim all resources of a long task.</p><p>• Resource slack is common in cluster computing. Memory slack could come from intentional overprovisioning at job launch to avoid Out-Of-Memory errors, dynamic and epochal memory demands at different job stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, or diminishing memory demands towards job completion. CPU slack is due to similar reasons. Even if CPU is fully utilized, gracefully reducing CPU allocation does not cause drastic performance degradation to a preempted task.</p><p>• Since tasks' requests are usually based on their peak demands, the partially reclaimed resources from preempted tasks are often sufficient for high priority tasks to make progress at an early stage of execution.</p><p>To reclaim resources from a preempted task, the cluster scheduler controls the iteration of graceful preemption. This process stops if the demands of the high priority tasks are satisfied. Similar to immediate preemption, in which we deprive the container of CPU to throttle task execution so as to accelerate memory reclamation, graceful preemption freezes a container's CPU when swapping activities are detected. Graceful preemption will continue until new tasks' demands are met. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">BIG-C: Preemptive Cluster Scheduling</head><p>In this section, we describe how to integrate containerbased task preemption into YARN. We begin with a brief overview of YARN's resource management and task scheduling ( §4.1). Next, we present the design of BIG-C and discuss the changes in YARN to support task preemption ( §4.2), and present a preemptive fair share scheduler based on YARN's capacity scheduler ( §4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">YARN Resource Management</head><p>YARN is a generic resource management framework that allows multiple applications to negotiate resources on a shared cluster. YARN uses container, a logical bundle of resources (e.g., h1 CPU, 2GB RAMi) as the resource allocation unit. A container is considered as a resource lease and its resources are reclaimed as a whole when a task is completed or killed. The resource manager (RM), one per cluster, is responsible for allocating containers to competing applications. The application master (AM), one per application, submits requests for containers to RM. The node manager (NM), one per machine, monitors the allocation of resources on each node and updates the RM with resource availability. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows the architecture of BIG-C. The key components of BIG-C include a resource monitor (RMon), a preemptive fair scheduler at the RM and a container allocator (CA), a container monitor (CM) at each NM. Container allocator Although YARN also uses the notion of "container" in resource management, a YARN container is a logical representation of a task's resources but does not control the actual allocation of resources. The CA component addresses this issue. Upon receiving the request for launching a new task, CA loads the task into a Docker container. Next, CA configures the container with the resources requested by the task. Container monitor is a per-container daemon in NM responsible for container preemption. Instructed by the NM, CM performs two actions: container suspend and container resume (SR operations in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4)</ref>. It reconfigures the preempted container to reclaim resources. If memory swapping is detected in a container, CM immediately freezes the container by setting the CPU allocation to 1%. Resource monitor is a daemon running on the resource manager. It periodically (every 3 seconds) checks the resource distribution among queues according to the current scheduling policy, the resource availability, and resource demands of incoming tasks. Based on the resource sharing policy enforced by the scheduler, RMon together with the scheduler compute how much resource should be preempted from over-provisioned queues and send the preemption decision to individual NMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">BIG-C Design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Preemptive Fair Share Scheduler</head><p>Overview The preemptive scheduler is built on YARN's capacity scheduler, which enforces fair resource allocation among users. Capacity scheduler is workconserving and allows users, each assigned with a job queue, to use more than their fair shares if there are available resources in the cluster. When resources are contended, capacity scheduler kills tasks from over-provisioned queues to free resources for underprovisioned queues. The preemptive scheduler replaces kill-based preemption with immediate preemption (IP) or graceful preemption (GP). While IP does not require algorithmic changes to capacity scheduler, we need to augment the fair sharing algorithm to support GP. Capacity scheduler's fair sharing algorithm enforces dominant resource fairness (DRF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> among job queues. Upon receiving resource requests, in the form of hCPU, RAMi, capacity scheduler calculates the dominant resource in these requests and enforces fair allocation of the dominant resource. Non-dominant resources are allocated in proportion to the dominant resource as specified in the requests. Algorithm 1 shows how capacity scheduler calculates the amount of resources to be reclaimed from over-provisioned queues and our modification (highlighted in red) to support GP. For ease of discussion, the algorithm assumes two queues, i.e., one for long jobs and one for short jobs, and two type of resources, i.e., CPU and memory. It can be extended to support more than two queues and two resources.</p><p>Capacity scheduler first determines the desired share of resource (line 3). The over-provisioned resources for the long job queue is the difference between the queue's current resource allocation~ r l and its desired share ~ f l (line 4). If the demand of the short jobs is less than the long job's over-occupied resources, the demand can be fully satisfied (line 5-6). Otherwise, all over-provisioned resources should be reclaimed (line 9). The amount of preempted resources ~ p is used in Algorithm 2 to determine Algorithm 1 Calculate resources to be preempted.</p><p>1: Variables: Long job's fair share f l , current resource allocation ~ r l , fair allocation ~ f l ; total CPU C and memory M resources; short job's resource request ~ r s ; over-provisioned resources ~ a; resources of long job to be preempted ~ p. return ~ p 19: end procedure which containers that belong to the long job should be killed to release these resources.</p><note type="other">2: /* Long job's fair and over-provisioned resources */ 3: ~ f l = (C ⇥ f l , M ⇥ f l ) 4: ~ a =~ r l 񮽙 ~ f l 5: if~ r s &lt; ~ a then 6: ~ p =~ r s 7: else 8: /* Use DR to calculate preempted resources*/ 9:</note><formula xml:id="formula_0">~ p = ~ a =) ~ p = COMPUTEDR(~ r s ,~</formula><p>As shown in Algorithm 2, capacity scheduler uses the heuristic proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to choose a job with the longest remaining time and releases ~ p resources from its containers. Note that ~ p is calculated in algorithm 1. Each time such a container is found, it is added to the kill set C until either the job has no container left or ~ p has been satisfied (line 3-9). If more resources need to be reclaimed, capacity scheduler moves to the next job (line 10). Note that as long as the over-provisioned dominant resource is fully reclaimed, ~ p is considered satisfied. The to-bekilled container set C is then sent to NMs to perform the killings (line 13). There are two drawbacks of capacity scheduler due to kill-based preemption. First, kill-based preemption may lead to resource fragmentation. A killed long job container may be too large for one short task but not sufficient for two short tasks. Second, task killing is not a flexible way to reclaim resource. The killing of a large container only frees resources on one machine and may lead to the launch of a large number of small tasks all clustered on the machine, causing not only load balancing but also reliability problems.</p><p>We make simple changes to capacity scheduler to address the above drawbacks. To avoid resource fragmentation, the preempted resource is accurately calculated by function COMPUTEDR based on the demand of short jobs and over-provisioned resources (Algorithm 1, line Algorithm 2 Container preemption.</p><p>1: Variables: Set of container to be preempted C; resources to be preempted ~ p; preempted resources at each GP step ~ r GP ; resources of a preempted container~ r c . 20 GB RAMi. Note that resource preemption based on the dominant resource of short job requests is not possible in the original capacity scheduler because resource allocation of long jobs' containers is based on long jobs' dominant resource and should be reclaimed as a whole.</p><p>Further, we introduce graceful task preemption in Algorithm 2. When a job is selected, its over-provisioned resources are reclaimed from a large number of its tasks at a step of~ r GP . For each round, the remaining resources of a container c are also updated (line 7). Once a container starts swapping, showing a memory shortage, it is immediately frozen and removed from resource reclamation (line 8). As such, preempted resources are collected from many containers, avoiding drastic slowdown to individual containers as much as possible. As discussed in §2.2, evenly preempting resources from tightly-coupled tasks help minimize slowdowns of Spark jobs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical considerations</head><p>Tuning ~ r GP . The step at which resources are preempted in graceful preemption presents a tradeoff. The larger the ~ r GP , (hopefully) the sooner the short jobs' demand can be satisfied, but at the risk of causing more pronounced slowdown to long jobs. If ~ r GP is too large and pre-empted containers incur swapping, short jobs can even wait longer for resources to be freed from swapping containers. Small~ r GP leads slow resource allocation to short jobs, which may suffer poor performance after launch. Delayed resumption factor D. Killed and preempted tasks resubmit their resource requests to the RM and are treated like ordinary incoming tasks. However, resource request from a preempted task has a special locality requirement -it can only be satisfied on the machine where the task was preempted. Moreover, under high burst of short job arrival, a resumed container can be quickly preempted again. The repeated and wasteful preemptions hurt long job performance but also cause long queuing delay to short jobs. To address this issue, we require that a preempted container needs to try D times before it is really resumed. This also avoids possible starvation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Implementation</head><p>We have implemented BIG-C in Hadoop YARN. The resource monitor is a new module residing in the resource manager that extends SchedulingEditPolicy. Our new preemptive fair share scheduler is based on YARN's capacity scheduler. The modifications includes adding a new task state PREEMPTED, interfaces for task suspension and resumption in the resource manager. These changes are generic and can interface with any cluster schedulers. On node manager, the container monitor extends ContainerManagerImpl. We build a new module called CoresManager to handle CPU allocation at worker nodes. A Java interface for libcontianer is added to each node manager to operate Docker containers. Our implementation includes 2000 lines of Java code and is based on Hadoop-2.7.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>This section presents the performance evaluation of BIG-C on a 26-node cluster using representative MapReduce and Spark workloads. We first provide details of our testbed ( §5.1). Next, we present results from synthetic workloads with MapReduce and Spark jobs ( §5.2), and study the sensitivity of two tunable parameters in our design ( §5.3). Last, we give results from production workloads based on the Google trace ( §5.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Cluster Setup Each machine in the 26-node cluster has two 8-core Intel Xeon E5-2640 processors with hyperthreading enabled, 132GB of RAM, and 5x1-TB hard drivers configured as RAID-5. The machines were interconnected by 10 Gbps Ethernet. Hadoop-2.7.1. was deployed on the cluster and HDFS was configured with a replication factor of 3 and a block size of 128MB. The worker nodes sent heartbeats to the resource manager every 3 seconds. Docker-1.12.1 was used to create containers and the images were downloaded from online repository sequenceiq/hadoop-docker.</p><p>We configured two queues in YARN's resource manager to serve heterogeneous workloads. One queue was dedicated to short jobs and the other was for long jobs. Such a two-queue setting is commonly used in production systems and has been adopted by other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Additionally, BIG-C can leverage approaches presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> to classify short and long jobs. To enforce strictly higher priority for short jobs, we set the resource share of the short job queue to 95%. The remaining 5% was assigned to the long job queue in a besteffort manner. For comparison, we evaluated the following cluster schedulers:</p><p>• FIFO scheduler serves all tasks in a single first-infirst-out queue. It achieves optimal performance for long jobs, but incurs significant performance penalty for short jobs.</p><p>• Reserve schedulers such as Hawk <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> reserve a portion of the cluster to run short jobs exclusively without preemption. Our experiments empirically reserve 60% of cluster resources for short jobs. Long jobs can use up to 40% of cluster capacity. However, it is challenging to find the optimal reservation factor under highly dynamic workloads.</p><p>• Kill is the preemption mechanism in YARN. The capacity scheduler is used to enforce share between queues. It achieves optimal performance for short jobs, but causes performance degradation to long jobs.</p><p>• IP and GP are immediate preemption and graceful preemptions, respectively. Our preemptive fair share scheduler is used with these two approaches.</p><p>Workloads We used Spark-SQL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to generate TPC-H queries as short jobs. Hive <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> was used to populate TPC-H tables in HDFS. The total data size was 10GB. The container size for Spark-SQL tasks were set to h4 CPU, 4GBi. We selected long jobs from HiBench benchmarks. For MapReduce jobs, we chose map-heavy wordcount and reduce-heavy terasort. The map and reduce containers were set to h1 CPU, 2GBi and h1 CPU, 4GBi, respectively. The input size of the MapReduce jobs was 600GB. We selected PageRank, Kmeans, Bayes and WordCount from HiBench as the Spark jobs. The containers of Spark executors were much larger with configurations of h8 CPU, 16GBi, h8 CPU, 32GBi, and h16 CPU, 32GBi, depending on the input size. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Metrics We evaluated the cluster schedulers using the following metrics: job completion time (JCT) is the time when job is submitted until it is completed; job queueing delay is the time when a job is submitted until its execution starts; CoV of JCT is JCT's coefficient of variation; cluster utilization is the CPU utilization over the total CPU capacity of the cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results on Synthetic Workloads</head><p>Setting In this experiment, we created a controlled environment to study the performance of BIG-C. We generated three workload patterns, each with mixed long and short jobs and lasting for 900 seconds. Long jobs were continuously submitted throughout the experiment and persistently utilized about 80% of the cluster resources. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>(a) shows the submission pattern of short jobs. While all three patterns had a base demand of around 20% cluster capacity, they differed in the submission bursts. High-load and low-load generated approximately 90% and 40% cluster utilizations, respectively, during the burst period between the 300 th and 700 th seconds. In contrast, multi-load had two peaks during the burst period with each peak demanding over 80% cluster resources. Clearly, the cluster was overloaded during the bursts and long jobs should be preempted by short jobs. Spark performance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>(b)-(g) shows the results. Among schedulers, reserve achieved the best performance for short jobs under low-load and multi-load, since the reserved 60% cluster resources were sufficient to serve the burst. Under high-load, Reserve had degraded performance as the resource reservation for short jobs was less than the peak demand. Kill was among the best performing schedulers for all three scenarios. In contrast, FIFO inflicted substantially delays to short jobs due to the absence of preemption. Short jobs needed to wait for the completion of long jobs before they can be scheduled. Our approaches IP and GP with the preemptive fair scheduler achieved close performance to the best performing schedulers. Overall, GP had superior performance than IP as it required less resource reclamation time before short jobs can be launched. We draw the 50 th percentile and 90 th percentile performance for long Spark jobs to show the median and the long tail JCTs. FIFO achieved the best performance for long jobs because short jobs were unable to preempt and interrupt long job execution. In contrast, kill based preemption incurred significant delays to long jobs, especially for the 90 th percentile JCT, in all scenarios. It caused on average 140% degradation compared to FIFO for the tail JCT. Note that kill-based preemption did not affect the median performance much under low-load since only a few long jobs were killed.</p><p>In comparison, IP had the worst median and tail performance among all schedulers under low-load. Its aggressive resource preemption and the resulted memory swapping even affected the median JCT under low-load, in which other non-preempted jobs suffered degradation due to memory thrashing. Another reason for IP's poor performance was because complete suspension of one task in Spark jobs often stops the entire job due to task synchronization. Note that even reserve, which only dedicated 40% cluster capacity to long jobs, achieved better performance than kill and IP, indicating that long queuing delay was less damaging on performance than aggressive killings and preemptions. Finally, GP was the best performing scheduler compared to baseline FIFO. It incurred 13%, 61%, and 17% penalty to the tail performance compared to FIFO under low-load, high-load, and multi-load, respectively. The slightly worse median performance of GP compared to kill was the evidence that many tasks were slowed down due to the collection of preempted resources on these tasks. Another important finding is that kill-based preemption caused 13%, 15%, and 20% of long jobs failed to complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . In contrast, although IP incurred significant overhead, it caused no jobs to fail. MapReduce performance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows the results of MapReduce workloads. The long job performance is normalized to the scenario in which the cluster is dedicated to long jobs. The short jobs were the same Spark-SQL queries while the long jobs were map-heavy wordcount and reduce-heavy terasort. MapReduce jobs differ from Spark jobs in many ways. First, a long job usually contains a large number of small mappers, which complete quickly. Second, while Spark's in-memory computing imposes persistent resource demand throughout job execution, MapReduce jobs show clear decline in demand when entering the reduce phase. Finally, MapReduce tasks persist intermediate data onto disk whenever their memory buffers are full. These differences led to different findings in MapReduce workloads. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> does not show the results of FIFO because the background long jobs had a large number of mappers backlogged and most short jobs suffered 15-20 minutes slowdown. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref>(a)-(c), it is unexpected that kill incurred significant queuing delay to short jobs while both IP and GP performed much better. An examination of YARN's job submission log revealed that the large numbers of killed MapReduce tasks were immediately resubmitted to the scheduler and later killed again, causing wasted cluster resources and additional queuing delays to short jobs. In contrast, both IP and GP is configured with delayed resumption, which avoided repeated preemptions. Reserve had superior performance among the schedulers except for the scenario under high-load, in which the reservation was not sufficient. Both IP and GP performed well for short jobs.  For long MapReduce jobs, the performance of schedulers depends on the type of the long job workloads. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6(d)</ref>, kill, IP, and GP had similar performance for map-heavy workload wordcount. It suggests that kill-based preemption is not particularly more expensive than container-based preemption as the mappers are usually small. Because there are a large number of mappers, which are independent from each other, the lost work due to the killings of small mappers can be overlapped with other mappers backlogged in the scheduler. In contrast, kill-based preemption incurred substantial overhead to reduce-heavy terasort workload. The cost of killing a reduce task is prohibitively high as relauching the killed reducer requires re-shuffling all its input data over the network.</p><p>Both IP and GP achieved near-optimal performance with IP incurring slight degradation under high-load and multi-load. The write-back of dirty data effectively reduces the in-memory footprint of preempted tasks, making it easier for IP and GP to reclaim memory compared to that in Spark jobs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Parameter Sensitivity</head><p>As discussed above, the delayed resumption in our approaches effectively avoided repeated preemptions. In this section, we evaluate the effects of two configurable parameters in our approach. The first parameter is the number of tries a preempted container needs to perform before it is actually resumed. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7(a)</ref> shows the effect of varying numbers of the delayed try D on short job performance. The figure suggests that delayed resumption is critical to guaranteeing low latency for short jobs. Disabling delayed resumption (D = 0) led to queuing delay as high as 80 seconds for short jobs. Enabling delayed preemption had salient impact on performance but with diminishing gain when further increasing D. We empirically set resumption factor D to 3 to strike a balance between short job latency and long job starvation. This setting was used in all other experiments.</p><p>We have shown that there exist tradeoffs between aggressive and graceful resource preemption. Next, we quantitatively study how the granularity (aggressiveness) of GP affects long job performance. We use the coefficient of variance (CoV) of JCT to measure the distribution of preempted resources. The basic preemption unit was set to h1 CPU, 2GB RAMi. The GP granularity is determined by how many basic resource units should be reclaimed in one round. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 7(b)</ref> shows that the CoV of job completion time increased as we increased the granularity of GP. Compared to kill-based and immediate preemptions, graceful preemption, even with aggressive resource reclamation, still incurred less variation across jobs. We set the preemption granularity to h2 CPU, 4GB RAMi, i.e., two basic units.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Overhead</head><p>The overhead of BIG-C mainly comes from reclaiming the memory of preempted tasks and the delay caused by memory restoration. Our experiments show that it takes approximately 3 seconds to reclaim 1GB dirty memory, which adds considerable scheduling delay to short jobs. Although BIG-C avoids such overhead for most of time due to graceful preemption, performance degradation is inevitable if GP fails to satisfy short job demands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Results on the Google Trace</head><p>We also evaluated BIG-C by replaying the production Google trace on our testbed. This trace contains 2202 jobs, of which 2020 are classified as short jobs and 182 as long jobs based on job completion time and resource usage. The setting conforms with that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We scaled down the task numbers in each job to match our cluster capacity so that each job takes a reasonable amount of time to complete. The total trace ran for 3.8 hours. We first dedicated the entire cluster to short jobs and long jobs to respectively quantify their resource usage. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8</ref>(a). The average cluster utilization was about 17% and 75% for short and long jobs, respectively. The short jobs only consumed a small portion of the total resource, but with highly variable and unpredictable submission rates. We can clearly see a few short job usage spikes throughout the trace. For example, the spike at the 8000 th second used up to 95% of the cluster capacity. Similarly, we configured the short job share to be 95% of the cluster capacity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8</ref>(b) plots the latency distribution of short job in the Google trace. Most schedulers except FIFO achieved good performance. FIFO had a 90 th percentile latency of 335s, which was 6 times larger than its median latency. We also examined the tail latency under other schedulers. The 95 th percentile latency for reserve, kill, IP, and GP were 183s, 176s, 118s, and 96s, respectively. Our two approaches outperformed other schedulers with GP being the best. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8</ref>(c) draws the 50 th percentile and 90 th percentile performance for long jobs. With the default killbased preemption, 105 out of the 182 long jobs were killed, among which 41 failed and 105 suffered significant slowdown due to job re-launch. Note that failed jobs were excluded from JCT calculation. As shown in the figure, GP improved the 90 th percentile job runtime by 67%, 37% and 32% over kill, IP, and reserve, respectively. Compared to the optimal FIFO scheduler for long jobs, GP only added 4% delay to JCT. Similarly, about 23% long jobs failed with kill-based preemption while our approaches did not cause any job failures. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 8</ref>(d) plots the cluster utilization under different schedulers. Work-conserving schedulers achieved much higher resource utilizations than reserve did. For more than 60% of time in the experiment, the overall cluster utilization was above 80% for FIFO, kill, IP, and GP. In contrast, reserve rarely used more than 60% of cluster capacity due to the reservation for short jobs. Note that both kill and IP had periods when the cluster utilization was lower than 40%. This was due to the killing and aggressive preemption of tasks that impeded the overall progress of the tightly-coupled long jobs, e.g., Spark jobs. When waiting for the killed or preempted task to relaunch or resume, other sibling tasks were idling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>The last few years have witnessed the growth of workloads provisioned on top of data processing frameworks like Hadoop <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Naiad <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> or Spark <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The characteristics of such workloads have been well-studied in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Cluster Scheduling is a core component in dataintensive cluster computing. YARN <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and Mesos <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are two widely used open-source cluster managers. Both YARN and Mesos use a two-level architecture, decoupling allocation from application-specific logic such as task scheduling, speculative execution or failure handling. Omega <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> is a parallel scheduler architecture based on lock-free optimistic concurrency control to achieve implementation extensibility, globally optimized scheduling, and scalability. Another thread of work focuses on distributed scheduler to overcome the scalability problem in large-scale clusters. Sparrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> is a fully distributed scheduler that performs scheduling by performing randomized sampling. Hawk <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and Mercury <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> both implement a hybrid scheduler to avoid inferior scheduling decisions for a subset of jobs as a trade-off of scheduling quality and scalability. yaq-d and yaq-c <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> provides queue management at worker nodes to improve cluster utilization and to avoid head-of-line blocking. Our proposed container-based preemption is orthogonal to these approaches and helps simplify the design of cluster schedulers by providing an alternative means of enforcing task priority. Note that our work does not intend to improve task classification but focuses on a lightweight mechanism for task preemption. Preemption Amoeba <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Natjam <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> implement preemption using checkpointing to achieve elastic resource allocation. Natjam targets at Hadoop applications and Amoeba built a prototype based on Sailfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Li et. al., propose a new checkpoint mechanism by leveraging CRIU <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Their approaches interact with the Application Master and dump the checkpoints to user space. There are two drawbacks in checkpoint-based preemption. First, it is challenging to determine the frequency of checkpointing. On-demand checkpointing, such as the preemption approaches based on CRIU <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, requires the entire preempted task to be dumped onto HDFS and is equivalent to our proposed immediate preemption. Periodic checkpointing at each iteration reduces preemption delay but incurs considerable runtime overhead. Second, existing checkpointing approaches require changes to user applications. Our proposed container-based preemption is application agnostic and the tuning of the GP granularity is relatively straightforward. Utilization To improve cluster utilization, authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> propose to consolidate applications on a shared infrastructure and separately manage their interference so that applications' QoS could be guaranteed. These techniques employ online profiling to identify the best combinations of workloads that do not interfere with each other. However, in data center scheduling, in which job submissions are unpredictable and the composition of jobs is heterogeneous, offline training or online profiling may not be accurate. Our approach does not require the cluster to be under-provisioned nor assumes scheduling-friendly job submissions. Lightweight virtualization Container-based virtualization have been widely used both in industry and in research. Xavier et. al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> evaluated the HPC performance in container based environments. Burns et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> propose a new design pattern for container based distributed systems. Google Borg <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> has used OS container to aid cluster management. However, its container usage is limited to task isolation and preemption is still based on task killing. Harter et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> propose a Docker storage driver to enable fast container startup. The YARN community has also provided support to run Docker containers to replace the logical YARN container. However, there still lacks support to fully control the resource allocation to containers in YARN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of scheduling heterogeneous workloads on a shared cluster. Inspired by task scheduling in operating systems, in which fast and low-cost preemption is key to achieving both responsiveness and high utilization, we leverage lightweight virtualization to enable task preemption in cluster computing, such as YARN. Experimental results show that our proposed mechanism for preemption is effective for different types of Big Data workloads, e.g., MapReduce and Spark. Note that container-based preemption is not yet suitable for workloads with sub-second latency, like those studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Suspending and saving the context of a data-intensive task still takes a few seconds. Providing extremely low-latency task preemption for subsecond workloads is an interesting future direction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1</head><label></label><figDesc>https://github.com/yncxcw/big-c</figDesc></figure>
