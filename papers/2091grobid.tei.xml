				<p>The Miss Ratio Curve (MRC) represents a fundamental tool for cache performance profiling. Approximate methods based on sampling provide a low-complexity solution for MRC construction. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that, in case of content with a large variance in popularity, the approximate MRC may be highly sensitive to the set of sampled content. We study in detail the impact of content popularity heterogeneity on the accuracy of the approximate MRC. We observe that few, highly popular, items may cause large error at the head of the reconstructed MRC. From these observations, we design a new approach for building an approximate MRC, where we combine an exact portion of the MRC with an approximate one built from samples. Results for different real-world traces show that our algorithm computes MRC with an error up to 10 times smaller than state-of-the-art methods based on sampling, with similar computational and space overhead.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Caches have been widely used in different contexts to improve system performance, from CPU, to disk, to web. As the architectures become more complex, with multi-core CPUs, or clusters of machines, caches maintain a key role in providing fast access to the most used content. Being a shared resource, a cache may be misused by some aggressive processes or application, hurting the performance of other processes.</p><p>To provide a fair sharing, one may virtually divide the cache and assign dynamically different portions to specific applications or types of applications. For instance, Sundarrajan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> show that, in case of Web caches, video streaming, web browsing, and software updates have extremely different content access patterns and cache resource requirements. Similarly, when multiple VMs run on the same physical host, efficient sharing of storage resources, like a SSD used as cache, needs detailed VM profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Analogous observations have been made in different contexts, such as multiprocessor systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> and distributed processing in datacenters <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</p><p>The most important performance metric for a cache is usually the hit ratio. For cache partitioning, it is necessary to quantify the hit ratio a given application would experience given the amount of available cache space. This relation is captured by the Miss Ratio Curve (MRC), which gives the miss ratio as a function of the cache size. The use of MRCs can be helpful also in contexts where caches can be provisioned on demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> with a pay-as-you-go model, as it is in the case for cloud caches <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>MRC can be computed analytically for many caching policies-sometimes exactly <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, more often approximately <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>-but only under idealized models for the request process. Real traffic usually exhibits complex patterns that diverge from these models.</p><p>A more common approach, dating back to Mattson's seminal work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, is to compute the MRC directly from the trace of the specific workload. The MRC can be built with O(log M) computational complexity per request, and O(M) memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, where M is the number of distinct items that are requested. Since content popularity (and consequently the MRC) may vary over time, the usual approach is to select an interval of time over which the traffic request process may be considered stationary. Then, the requests observed during this interval are used to build a MRC, which drives the resource assignment for the next interval. In case of high traffic rate, if we need to continuously build many MRCs for different application types, computational complexity and memory requirements may represent a heavy burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p><p>For this reason, by trading accuracy with computational complexity and memory, recent works propose to compute approximate MRCs with O(1) operations per request, and O(1) memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Such low-complexity solutions are based on the common idea of sampling the trace. Limitation of the prior work. Sampling has been applied widely in different domains. A potential pitfall of sampling is the introduction of biases. In building the approximate MRC, there could be two approaches: sampling the requests <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, or sampling the items and observing the requests for those items <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Request sampling introduces a bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, which motivated the introduction of item sampling, also called spatial sampling. Nevertheless, if request rates vary greatly across items, spatial sampling can be biased too, a fact that was implicitly acknowledged by <ref type="bibr">Waldspurger et al. [37]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to thoroughly address and explain such a bias in detail.</p><p>As an example, the left column of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the exact and approximate MRCs using the LRU eviction policy, built from various samples, considering traces with different traffic characteristics. In particular, item request frequencies, usually referred to as popularities, are Zipf-distributed with two different values of the Zipf exponent (α)-experiments' details are provided in Section 3, but they are not essential to understand what follows. With higher values of α, the distribution becomes more skewed, and therefore popularities become highly heterogeneous. The approximate MRCs in the left column are obtained using SHARDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> with a constant sampling rate R = 0.01. The experiments show that SHARDS is able to obtain an accurate MRC when item popularity is not highly skewed. But, as heterogeneity increases, the error drastically increases. <ref type="bibr">Waldspurger et al. [37]</ref> recognized this possible bias, and proposed the variant SHARDS adj that partially solves the problem. The curves in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, right column, show that SHARDS adj correctly estimates the tail of the MRC, but not its head, with large errors for high miss ratio values (above 30% in the bottom subfigure) that may even exceed 100% (top subfigure). Miss ratios above 70% are the norm for many caches, including HDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and SSD ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, and hierarchical web caches, where the higher level resides in RAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Caches consist of fast, expensive storage, and they are inherently a scarce, shared resource. An accurate assignment requires the knowledge of the MRC for any size, even when the miss ratio is large.</p><p>Contributions. In this work we study the impact of heterogeneity on the accuracy of the approximate MRC. With the help of different sets of experiments, and a model of a representative scenario, we observe that highly popular item play a fundamental role, and we shed lights on the fact that the MRC is highly sensitive to the specific content sampled. Consequently, we design a new approach, where we combine exact MRC computation for small values of the cache capacity (which is mainly influenced by popular items) with approximate computation for larger values. We evaluate our scheme with both synthetic and real-world traces. Our results show that our method is able to reconstruct the MRC with an average error up to 10 times smaller than state of the art approaches, with the same complexity. We also consider a scenario where items have heterogeneous sizes, and show how our solution correctly addresses it.</p><p>Roadmap. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide the background information  and discuss the related work. In Section 3 we study the impact of popular items on the accuracy of the spatial sampling approaches. Section 4 presents our solution, which is evaluated in Section 5. Section 6 provides additional considerations on the scheme we propose, and Section 7 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>The MRC can be computed with a single pass on the request trace if the eviction policy satisfies the inclusion property, i.e., the set of items stored in the cache at a given time is a subset of the set of items that would be stored if the cache had a larger size <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Widely adopted policies such as LRU, LFU, and MRU satisfy such property, therefore MRCs are useful in many practical systems. Methods with different computational and memory requirements have been proposed to build the MRC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. We describe here a specific algorithm suitable when all items have the same size. The caching policies listed above all maintain an ordered list of the items in the cache, where, at any instant, the last item in the list is the current candidate to be evicted. The MRC algorithm goes through the trace, maintaining an ordered list T of references to the items mimicking how the corresponding caching policy would work if the cache size were infinite. Given a request for item j, if the item is not in the cache, we have a cold miss. If the item is in the cache, then the algorithm determines its current position (called the reuse distance) and updates an empirical histogram of reuse distances. Once the trace is analyzed, the histogram is normalized dividing each value by the total number of requests. By summing the histogram values up to a given capacity C, one obtains the corresponding hit ratio, whose one's complement is the miss ratio.</p><p>Exact MRC computation requires O(M) memory, where M is the number of distinct items in the trace, and has a computational complexity of O(log M) per request due to the access to T , which can be implemented with a tree data structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>The approximate solutions based on sampling may adopt two approaches: request sampling and item sampling. The solutions based on request sampling-such as sampling every n requests <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, or sampling for small intervals of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>are known to be biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. To overcome these issues, item sampling has been recently proposed for computing the reuse distance to characterize the use of storage memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> or program locality in single core <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and multi-core architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and for building approximate MRC with low computational complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p><p>In this work we consider the solution adopted by SHARDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. SHARDS selects randomly a fraction R of the items, computes the MRC considering only the requests from these items, and then scales the cache capacity on the X-axis by a factor 1/R. The item selection is done using a hash of the item identifier, id j . Since sampling may exclude or include very popular items, the authors of SHARDS proposed an adjustment, called SHARDS adj , in which the estimated miss ratios are scaled up by the ratio between the actual and the expected number of sampled references.</p><p>How to measure the Accuracy. In evaluating the approximate MRCs, accuracy is usually measured using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE): this is the average of the absolute differences between the exact and the approximate MRC for all cache sizes considered. Such a metric is easy to interpret, but it gives the same importance to all different values of cache size. The following simple example illustrates a potential problem. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the exact and approximate MRC obtained with SHARDS for a publicly available trace which we name ms-ex-trace details in Section 5.3. In the figure on the left, the two curves look similar and indeed the MAE is only 0.025, i.e., if we pick an arbitrary value of the cache size, on average the approximate MRC allow us to estimate the miss rate with an error of ±2.5%. The figure on the right contains the same information but using a log scale for the X-axis. It appears that the average error is not representative. In fact, the error for small cache sizes can be 5-6 times bigger.</p><p>In this paper we introduce a new metric-MAEQ, Mean Absolute Error per Quantile-that maintains the simplicity of MAE, but it takes into account how much the MRC varies in the different intervals. While the MAE provides the average error for a cache size sampled uniformly at random, the MAEQ provides the average error when a miss ratio is sampled uniformly at random. In particular, the metric is based on the concept of quantiles. We consider different uniformly spaced quantiles for the miss ratio and identify the corresponding cache size intervals. For instance, if we consider  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, right, we identify the following intervals for cache sizes: The first interval goes from 0 to 50, the second one from 50 to 10 5 , the third from 10 5 to 8 · 10 5 , and the fourth one from 8 · 10 5 till the end. Note that no portion of the MRC falls below 0.2, so the last quantile is not considered. Once we have identified the ranges that correspond to the quantiles, we compute the MAE in each range, and then we average the MAE. More</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">formally, MAEQ = ∑ Q * i=1 MAE i /Q * ,</formula><p>where the interval i is defined by the quantile, and Q * is the number of quantile intervals considered. In practice, we consider quantiles with a step increment of 0.01: for each variation of 0.01 in the miss ratio, we compute the MAE, and then we take the average of the MAEs. If we compute the MAEQ for the above trace, we obtain 0.090, which provides a better idea of the accuracy of the approximate MRC, when we look at different miss ratio ranges.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Evaluation Methodology and Settings</head><p>In this section we evaluate the impact of content popularity heterogeneity on the accuracy of the approximate MRC. We consider the SHARDS and SHARDS adj approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> with a fixed sampling rate, denoted by R, which varies from 0.1 to 0.001. In order to have highly controllable experiments, we first consider a set of traces generated according to the Independent Reference Model (IRM), in which the probability that the next request for item i is constant over time and independent from the previous requests. We call this probability the popularity of content i and denote it as p i . In particular, we use the Zipf popularity distribution (p i ∝ i −α ) with different values of the parameter α. We have tested different combinations of catalogue size and trace length; in what follows we report the representative results for the case with 50M requests for a set of 10M items and different values of the parameter α.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the exact and approximate MRCs for different values of α (sampling rate R = 0.01). The results in left columns have been obtained using SHARDS, while the ones in the right column using SHARDS adj . Note that, with spatial sampling, we are able to build the MRC at points that are multiples of 1/R-this is why the approximated MRCs start at 1/R = 100.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results with the IRM Traces</head><p>In case of SHARDS, as α increases, the error increases significantly. The problem is partially solved by SHARDS adj , whose effect is to decrease the error in the tail of the MRC. This is obtained by rescaling the approximated MRC, but such a rescaling has an impact on the whole MRC, and it leads to significant errors for small cache values yielding miss ratios larger than 1. This detail was not discussed in the SHARDS work <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Our model in Section 3.3 explains these findings.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> we show SHARDS adj MAE and MAEQ values for different values of the sampling rate R and the Zipf parameter α-the case labeled as "0.6p" will be discussed later. Each value has been computed averaging five different samples. The MAE indicates an error smaller than 0.006, but, as we discussed above, such metric considers all cache sizes equally important. The MAEQ, instead, indicates an average error over the quantiles that, for α = 1.2 and R = 0.001 may be as high as 0.35, which better describes the difference between the exact and the approximate MRC.</p><p>On the head of the MRC. The presence of a relatively small number of highly popular items determines the accuracy of MRCs. If we observe the empirical item popularity distribution in real-world traces-we will show some examples in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>-we notice that there are often two groups of items: a small group with very popular items, and a large one with much less popular items.</p><p>Inspired by these real-world traces, we modify a Zipf distribution with α = 0.6 by adding 20 popular items, whose popularity is randomly selected between 0.005 and 0.01. Popularities have been normalized to guarantee that their sum equals one.   imate MRCs for a sampling rate R = 0.01 with SHARDS and SHARDS adj , respectively. With the addition of a few popular items (20 out of 10M) the accuracy of the approximate MRC is significantly affected. The MAE and the MAEQ are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, with the label "0.6p." This experiment confirms that, when sampling fails to capture the contribution of the popular items, the result may be heavily biased. On the other hand, less popular items have limited impact on the MRC and they may be sampled randomly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Understanding the role of popular items</head><p>We analyze a simple scenario for which we can derive an approximate model. Consider a finite set of items where there is a single very popular item (content c 1 ), with popularity p, and M items with approximately homogeneous popularity, i.e., each item has a popularity of approximately (1 − p)/M, and p (1 − p)/M. The request sequence is generated following the IRM model. Let r n denote the n-th request. We consider the reuse distance, i.e., the number of unique references between two references to the same item <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and the reuse time, i.e., the total number of references between two references to the same item <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For small cache sizes, the reuse distance can be approximated by the reuse time, i.e., misses for content c 1 occur (almost) every time the reuse time for the content exceeds the cache size C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The reuse distance is geometrically distributed with expected value 1/p. Then, the miss probability for content c 1 starts decreasing significantly as the cache reaches size 1/p, and decreases exponentially fast for bigger and bigger cache sizes. Once the cache size is 3 to 4 times larger than 1/p, content c 1 is highly likely to be in the cache and the miss ratio is at most 1 − p. For larger cache sizes, the miss rate still decreases because of the contribution of the unpopular items. The decrease is now linear in the cache size. This reasoning can be made formal, e.g., using a simple model based on the Che's approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and we obtain that the miss ratio  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows a sketch of what the miss ratio looks like using a logarithmic scale for the capacity axis-curve labeled "exact." Now, assume we sample the items with sampling rate R. Either the set of sampled items contains the very popular content (with probability R), or it does not contain it (with probability 1 − R). In the following, we consider these two cases and show that the resulting MRCs differ significantly from the exact MRC.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">m(C) ≈ pe −pC + (1 − p) 1 − C M .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Case 1: content c 1 is sampled. The sample contains requests for content c 1 and, on average, M = RM unpopular items. The fraction of requests for content c 1 is p = p/(p + (1 − p)R) &gt; p. The exact MRC of the sampled trace is determined by (1) with M and p replacing respectively M and p. For the approximate MRC, we replace C with RC and we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">m(C) ≈ p e −p RC + (1 − p ) 1 − C M .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The curve labeled "case 1" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, left, corresponds to (2). We observe a fast decrease of the miss ratio for cache sizes around 1/(p R) from 1 to 1 − p &lt; 1 − p. Then, the approximate MRC underestimates the miss ratio at least for large values of the cache size.</p><p>Case 2: content c 1 is not sampled. In this case there are on average M = RM equally popular items in the cache, then the miss ratio is</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">m(C) ≈ 1 − C M ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and is represented by the curve labeled "case 2" in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, left.</p><p>Adjustment proposed in SHARDS adj . SHARDS adj rescales the estimated MRC by a factor N S /(RN), where N S is the number of requests observed in the sample. For Case 1, we have N S = pN + RN(1 − p), and we obtain We observe then how SHARDS adj removes the bias for large capacity values but amplifies it for small ones, leading to a miss ration greater than 1 in this example (m adj (0 + ) ≈ p/R + (1 − p) &gt; 1). Similarly, for Case 2, we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">m adj (C) ≈ p R e −p RC + (1 − p) 1 − C M .<label>(4</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">m adj (C) ≈ (1 − p) 1 − C M .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>SHARDS adj correctly predicts the tail of the MRC, as for Case 1, but it now underestimates the head. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>, right, shows the curves that corresponds to Case 1 and Case 2 when using SHARDS adj .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Proposed solution</head><p>In the previous section we observed that popular and less popular items have different impacts on the MRC building process. These observations motivate our solution. We design a scheme, where we combine an exact MRC for small cache sizes (where the miss ratio depends mostly on the highly popular items), with an approximate MRC built from sampled items for large cache sizes. In particular, for the approximate MRC we use SHARDS adj , because it predicts the MRC tail better. The approach is qualitatively illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig- ure 6</ref>. For the portion of the MRC built from samples, the general scheme can adopt either a constant sampling rate or an adaptive sampling rate to achieve constant computational complexity. We discuss these two schemes below. Constant Sampling Rate Scheme. Algorithm 1 describes the solution we propose. We assume the use of the LRU eviction policy, but the scheme may be adapted easily to any policy that satisfies the inclusion property. The algorithm requires two parameters: B, which is the number of items for the exact MRC, and R s , which is the sampling rate. Given a set of requests for an unknown catalogue of items, we maintain two tree data structures respectively to build the exact MRC (T e ), and the approximate one (T s ). T e size equals B item references, while T s depends on the number of items in the trace and the sampling rate. Splay Trees or Counting BTrees are possible candidates for such data structures, since they have logarithmic complexity for the insert/delete operations. Instead, for the lookup we maintain a hash table.</p><p>Once the trace is processed, we build the exact MRC (m e (C)) and the approximate one (m s (C)). We then connect by continuity the approximate MRC starting from B, and modulating exponentially any potential step discontinuity (equal to m e (B) − m s (B)), i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">m(C) = m e (C) if C ≤ B, m s (C) + (m e (B) − m s (B))e − C−B 4B if C &gt; B.</formula><p>Notice that, if we set B = 0, we obtain SHARDS adj scheme with constant sampling rate. As for the parameters B and R s , we provide a sensitivity analysis in Section 5, while we discuss the general guidelines for setting them in Section 6. Here we anticipate that in our experiments no particular tuning was required.</p><p>As for R s , the considerations made by <ref type="bibr">Waldspurger et al. [37]</ref> are valid also in our case. As for B, in our experiments we notice that, even for traces with millions of items, only few hundreds have very high popularity, and a value of B as low as 10 3 item references provides very accurate results. For the same trace, if we use R s = 0.01, the memory necessary to hold the references to the sampled items is of the order of 10 4 item references, and B = 10 3 adds only a small fraction to that memory consumption.</p><p>The proposed scheme has a complexity O(log R s M), where M is the number of distinct items in the trace, which is due to accesses to T s . As for T e , since its size is constant (B item references), the cost for the data structure operations is O(1). Constant Complexity Scheme. A fixed sampling rate has computational complexity and memory requirements that depend on the number of sampled items, which may grow as we consider longer and longer traces. <ref type="bibr">Waldspurger et al. [37]</ref> propose an adaptive sampling method to maintain a O(1) complexity per requests. This can be achieved by fixing a priori the number s max of items to sample, and then tracking the s max items with smallest values of the hash function. As more requests are processed, the sampling rate implicitly converges to the minimum value required to maintain s max references. Our mixed approach can be easily adapted in this direction, by fixing the size of T s .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Methodology</head><p>We compare our solution with the state-of-the-art approaches based on spatial sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, both when the sampling rate is fixed, and when the complexity is constant. If not otherwise stated, we consider the SHARDS adj variant</p><p>In case of fixed sampling rate, SHARDS adj adopts a sampling rate R. Given a trace with M distinct items, the scheme keeps track of RM items. For a fair comparison with our scheme, we adopt a sampling rate R s that leads to keep track of the same number of item references, i.e., B + R s M = RM. If not otherwise stated, we set B = 1000 and R s = R − B/M. In most of our experiments, M is of the order of few millions, so with R = 0.01, R s is slightly smaller than R. In Section 5.2 we will show the impact of B on the accuracy.</p><p>In case of constant complexity, SHARDS adj fixes the number of operations by maintaining a constant number of item references s max . This means that the scheme requires 2 log(s max ) operations per request (where the factor 2 is due to the additional data structure to track the s max items with smallest hash). In our case, there is an additional cost of log B due to the exact portion of the MRC, so, to make a fair comparison, we set the size of T s to a value of s max such that log B + 2 log(s max ) = 2 log(s max ), i.e., s max = s max / √ B. In the following sections, we will report simply R or s max used for SHARDS adj <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The corresponding parameters of our scheme are computed as explained above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">IRM traces</head><p>We start testing our solution with the IRM traces described in Section 3. We focus on the two more problematic popularity   distributions: the Zipf one with α = 1.2, and the Zipf one with α = 0.6 modified by introducing 20 very popular items, labeled as "0.6p." <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> shows the approximate MRC, along with the MAE and MAEQ. Our solution is able to build approximate MRCs using the same amount of memory as SHARDS adj . The average error per quantile reaches at most 0.008 in case of an equivalent sampling rate as low as R = 0.001-the corresponding value of R s is 0.0004 for α = 1.2 and 0.0008 for the "0.6p" case. With SHARDS adj , instead, the error with R = 0.001 was more than 40 times larger (0.35) for α = 1.2 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3, right)</ref>. For most of the settings, our solution also slightly improves the MAE, being equal only for α = 1.2 and R = 0.001. Impact of B. The proposed scheme has a parameter B, which is the maximum cache size considered for the exact MRC. Recall that, if B = 0, we obtain SHARDS adj 's results. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, left, shows the impact of the accuracy for different values of B. We consider the default case with R = 0.01. Since the ratio B/M is less than 10 −3 , then the equivalent R s is approximately 0.01 too.</p><p>As we increase B, there is a significant error reduction. The reason can be seen looking at the approximate MRC, which is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, right. Since we have a sampling rate R s ≈ R = 0.01, only one of the 100 most popular items, on average, is sampled, so the approximate MRC is very inaccurate in the range <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref>. As our algorithm uses the approximate samplebased MRC starting from B + 1, as long as B is smaller than 100 (i.e., 1/R s ), the error of the approximate MRC also affects the final MRC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Real-world traces</head><p>We consider a set of publicly-available block I/O traces from SNIA IOTTA repository <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, along with traces from Akamai, a major CDN provider. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> summarizes the characteristics of the traces. From the SNIA IOTTA repository, we have considered the most recent trace-labeled as systor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>along with older traces collected at FIU <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and at Microsoft <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. For experimental reproducibility, we report here the details of the traces. For the fiu traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, we consider the subtrace IODedup/Web. The ms-ex is the trace named "Microsoft Enterprise Traces, Exchange Server Traces" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which have been collected for Exchange server for a duration of 24-hours-we consider the first 3.5 hours. The ms-dev is the trace named "Microsoft Production Server Traces -Development Tools Release" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The systor traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> collect requests for different block storage devices over 28 days: we consider one day (March, 9th) of the device called "LUN2." Finally, the CDN trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> contains multiple days of traffic, of which we consider portions of 6 hours-we tested different intervals finding similar qualitative results.</p><p>Request distribution. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the empirical popularity distribution for two representative traces (systor and CDN), since the others are similar. The distributions show the presence of two distinct groups of items: a head with highly popular items, and a power-law tail-the figure shows the exponent α of the fitting power law distribution.</p><p>Approximate MRC with Constant Sampling Rate. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 10</ref> shows the comparison between the exact MRC and the ones obtained with SHARDS adj (left column) and with our approach (right column) for some representative traces. In all cases we consider R = 0.01 and B = 1000. We have also computed the MAEQ (bottom subfigure).    Except for the ms-dev trace, SHARDS adj fails to build an accurate MRC, with MAEQ in the range 0.05-0.10. With our approach, instead, the MAEQ is always below 0.01, and the accuracy can be appreciated visually comparing the approximate and exact MRCs. The ms-dev trace is representative of the case in which SHARDS adj provides good accuracy: our approach is able to provide equally accurate results.</p><p>Approximate MRC with Constant Complexity. We recall (Section 4) that a constant complexity per request is achieved by putting a cap on the number of sampled items s max , and then to the total memory used (B + s max ). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (top) shows the MAEQ with SHARDS adj and with our approach for different memory sizes-if not otherwise stated B = 1000. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> (bottom) shows the MRC. As the number of items increases, the head of the approximate MRC with SHARDS adj converges to the exact shape. With our approach, the MAEQ is smaller, because the first B positions are always correct.</p><p>Overheads. The experimental campaign has been specifically designed to compare our scheme and SHARDS adj , and the memory used in both scenarios-constant sampling rate and constant complexity-as described in Section 5.1. We have evaluated the CPU usage using user and system time components as reported by /usr/bin/time. Our experiments confirm that SHARDS adj has a 75x speed up compared to the exact MRC computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Our scheme performs slightly worse with CPU usage on average 10%, and at most 20%, higher than SHARDS adj . While the asymptotic computational complexity of the two schemes is the same, ours requires indeed a few more operations per request. Under SHARDS adj , at each request, we need to compute the hash of the item identifier. With our scheme, in addition to this, we need to insert the item at the head of the tree data structure that keeps track of the first B positions (in case of a hit we first need to remove the item, but this does not happen at every request). The fact that CPU load only increases by 10% suggests that the overhead due to the additional insertion/deletion operations appears negligible in comparison to the hash computation cost. On a consumer laptop, our solution processed the traces in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> (which span multiple hours) in less than 30s. It can the be used, not only offline on collected traces, but also online, as requests arrive. In the latter case, one may select a duration for the observation interval, e.g., one hour or less, and the MRC is computed at the end of the interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Discussion</head><p>Parameter configuration. In Section 5 we have presented a sensitivity analysis with respect to the parameter B, the sampling rate R s (in case of constant sampling rate), and the maximum number of item references B + s max (in case of constant complexity). The choice of these parameters determines the amount of memory that will be used for the approximate MRC computation. Given the memory budget and using some simple characteristics of the trace, such as the number of items or the number of requests (which can also be estimated in an online setting), it is possible to estimate the maximum values for B and R s .</p><p>We have already shown that, due to the specific way in which the final MRC is built, one should adopt a value B ≥ 1/R s to avoid connecting the two MRCs at a point where the sampled one is very imprecise. Additional constraints, due to the specific context in which the MRCs are used, can drive the exact setting. For instance, if the cache needs to be split across different application types, their number and the total amount of storage available further limits B.</p><p>Extension to "non-stack" algorithms. The MRC construction technique in case of eviction policies that do not satisfy the inclusion property is different, i.e., one needs to compute the miss ratios for different cache sizes in parallel, and then join the results. <ref type="bibr">Waldspurger et al. [36]</ref> propose a general method where the miss ratio for cache size C is obtained simulating a cache with size RC with a request trace sampled with rate R. In their experiments they use the same scaling factor R for all the sizes, but our findings suggest that one wants to differentiate the sampling rate used, adopting a high (resp. low) sampling rate for small (resp. large) caches. The higher sampling rate for the small caches would be compensated by the smaller sampling rate used at large ones, so overall the memory requirement and the computational complexity could be maintained similar to the case with constant sampling rate.</p><p>Heterogeneous item size. Most of the work about MRC consider items with uniform sizes. In contrast, there are different scenarios, such as Web caches, where items have heterogeneous sizes. In this case, the MRC should inform the miss rate obtained for a given size of the cache in bytes, rather than in number of items. In order to build such a MRC, we need to modify the data structure used to keep track of the items in the cache as explained in Carra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. with SHARDS adj for the CDN trace. Notice that the X-axis now reports the cache size in MB. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12 (right)</ref> shows the results with our approach. By combining the exact MRC with the one built from the samples, we are able to build a more accurate MRC using the same amount of memory as used by SHARDS adj . The results are confirmed by the MAEQ, for which we obtain an average value of 0.007-almost one order of magnitude smaller than SHARDS adj 's value (0.052).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>Sampling has been applied to calculate approximate MRCs with limited computational complexity. The use of such a technique requires a careful design in order to avoid the introduction of biases in the MRC construction. In this work, using a set of experiments and a model of a representative scenario, we studied the impact of popular items on the accuracy of the MRC, and we proposed a new approach that uses exact MRC calculation for small cache sizes while relying on sampling for large ones. The results using different real-world traces show that our solution is able to build approximate MRC with an error per quantile one order of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art approaches, such as SHARDS adj . As a future work, we plan to study how the parameters of our scheme should be set online depending on the characteristics of the request stream.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Approximate MRCs built from samples compared to the exact MRC for different values of the parameter α of the Zipf distribution used for item popularity (R = 0.01): SHARDS (left column) and SHARDS adj (right column).</figDesc></figure>
