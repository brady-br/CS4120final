				<p>The increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm in structuring services for &quot;smart cities&quot; has led to an explosion of data generated, ingested, processed , and stored in the system. Traditional time-series databases being Cloud-based are not suitable for meeting the low-latency requirement of such geo-distributed smart services. We propose DataFog, a geo-distributed data-management platform at the edge of the network to cater to the needs of smart services for the IoT age. We identify key challenges towards building such a database over a widely geo-distributed and heterogeneous edge computing environment. Preliminary evaluations show the performance potential of DataFog in comparison to state-of-the-art distributed data-stores. DataFog is the first system, to the best of the authors&apos; knowledge, that is meant for data-management at the network edge.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Smart services based on the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure has increased the need for scalable data management platforms. Recently there have been industry proposals for managing IoT data using (cloud-based) platforms, for efficient analytics and also for monetizing the use of data by 3rd parties <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Situation awareness applications running on edge computing platforms utilizing the IoT infrastructure have tight low-latency requirements between sensing and actuation. Often such applications need timely data about the state of the physical environment -that too in the critical path of the application logic. Cloud-based data management platforms are incapable of meeting the timeliness requirements of such applications due to the inevitable high latency incurred due to wide-area network traversals. Further, with the ever increasing deployment of bandwidth intensive IoT platforms (especially cameras), there is an increasing pressure on the backhaul bandwidth to transport data back and forth between the edge and the Cloud. Both these factors point to the need for more efficient management of the data and the computation on the data at the edge of the network (i.e., close to the IoT platforms that are the sources for such data).</p><p>Building a datastore on an edge computing infrastructure, however, has its own set of peculiar challenges. The wide geo-distribution and heterogeneous nature of this infrastructure requires data-partitioning and replication policies that are commensurate with the latency requirements of applications. Traditional cloud-based datastores (such as Cassandra) do not differentiate between data items and partition them evenly across all the nodes for better load-balancing. In edge computing environments, where inter-node communication may have to traverse the Internet, an even partitioning of data is detrimental to the latency of queries. Moreover, the servers at the network edge are not as resource rich as their Cloud counterparts. Thus a data management platform that is edge friendly should simultaneously take advantage of the edge servers for low latency and the Cloud for abundance of resources. In this paper, we propose DataFog, a solution to these issues by designing a system that performs data partitioning between the edge and the Cloud based on contextual relevance of data-items in space and time. In the scope of this paper, we assume that all datastore nodes would be owned or rented by the same organization. Extending DataFog for federated operation across clusters managed by multiple parties is a prospective future work. In this paper, we make the following contributions as algorithmic insights of DataFog:</p><p>• A distributed indexing mechanism that performs data placement (both among edge nodes, and between the edge and the Cloud) based on spatiotemporal attributes to support efficient queries involving multiple edge nodes.</p><p>• A replica placement approach that provides both spatial proximity and resilience to geographicallycorrelated failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>• A location-aware load balancing policy to deal with sudden storage usage surges and hotspots by utilizing nearby edge nodes.</p><p>• A data-eviction and data-compression strategy based on temporal relevance that takes into account the low-storage capacity of edge nodes</p><p>The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the requirements of an edge-friendly data management platform using two motivating use cases. Section 3 describes the design of DataFog. Section 4 presents performance improvements of DataFog through results of preliminary evaluations. Section 5 summarizes the related work on data management for IoT and Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Requirements of situation-awareness applications</head><p>Smart-cities equipped with multi-modal sensing functionalities generate data continuously by sensing the environment. Raw data streams, e.g. video frames from smart cameras, need to be pre-processed to detect interesting objects or patterns, e.g. pedestrians or cars, to generate streams of events, which could in turn be used by applications as well. We describe two candidate applications to motivate the necessity of a data-management platform at the network edge.</p><p>• Suspicious vehicle tracking : A distributed camera network deployed on urban roadways generates streams of vehicle detections for continuous tracking of suspicious vehicles. Tracking vehicles in real time requires spatio-temporal range queries such as select all vehicle detections within 5 km and 10 minutes to be efficient. The distribution of workload is dependent on the distribution of vehicles in space, often leading to hotspots. Furthermore, for continuous operation, the camera network generates continuous streams of vehicle detections that need to be saved in a datastore.</p><p>• IoT to improve quality of life for people with disabilities : Information generated from smart cameras has the potential to help people with navigational challenges -who due to psychological issues prefer paths with less crowd density <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The navigation application needs to gather crowd density of nearby regions so as to navigate the person through the best possible path. Such a density estimate can be constructed using spatio-temporal range queries for recent measurements of crowd density at locations close to the user.</p><p>Note that the use-cases described above consume data generated by specific IoT subsystems (smart surveillance) for performing their functions. Based on these use-cases we present the key characteristics of applications that would benefit from DataFog.</p><p>1. Spatio-temporal locality in range queries : For each query, there is a spatio-temporal region such that data-items belonging to that region are more relevant than other data-items. For example, in the vehicle-tracking use-case mentioned earlier, the region of relevance for a range query would include all events within 5 km and within 10 minutes from the current detection. This region is relevant for real-time operations of an application, while on the other hand batch processing operations require data from a large area and over a long period of time.</p><p>2. Data-model : DataFog supports data-items having a field describing the type of data, location and timestamp fields and the value. Such a data-model allows DataFog to handle both continuous streams emitted by static sensors (e.g. crowd density monitoring) as well as streams concerning moving objects (e.g. vehicle tracking).</p><p>timestamp, and item-type attributes for partitioning data across nodes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Replication policy</head><p>Typical data replication serves two main purposes : loadbalancing and fault-tolerance. We intend to create multiple replicas both on edge nodes for low-latency as well as on remote datacenter nodes for tolerance from geographically correlated failures.</p><p>The replication policy of DataFog should take into account the requirements of replication policies in contemporary data-stores (e.g., Cassandra) like cross-rack and cross-datacenter replication (for fault-tolerance). Furthermore, due to the latency-sensitivity in edge computing environments, we incorporate a constraint that dictates the maximum distance between a replica node and the location of data-item and can be specified by the developer based on latency requirement of the application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Handling workload skews</head><p>DataFog's data partitioning ensures good load-balancing against skews in application workload. Its design is a hybrid one, that provides both spatial-proximity and even distribution of data placement. DataFog allows the application developer to configure load-balancing regions, such that all nodes belonging to the same region would balance workload among each other. The applicationdeveloper is allowed to specify the size of this region, based on the suitable tradeoff between latency and loadbalancing.</p><p>We plan to develop two mechanisms for adapting to hotspots. For long-lived hotspots, the administrator would launch and attach new datastore nodes to the running cluster. DataFog ensures that the newly added nodes balance load from the heavily loaded ones and bring down the average per-node traffic. For short-lived hotspots, we propose to develop an offloading mechanism that would allow heavily loaded nodes to offload a specific portion of its data-items to a lightly loaded node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Handling scarce resources at the edge</head><p>Resource capacities at the network edge are typically smaller than those in the cloud. DataFog should leverage the proximal location of edge nodes, but also take into account their resource scarcity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . To this end, we make the following design decisions for lowering storage use on edge nodes.</p><p>1 DataFog would be implemented by extending Cassandra, and thus inherits its resource requirements. Cassandra's throughput improves with higher cores and RAM and faster disks, and the developer can choose resource configuration based on the applications needs. However, a minimal edge node would require 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM. , t i+1 − t i+2 and t i+2 − t i+3 ), which are mapped to 2 physical nodes (A and B). Given a data item, we use the location to construct a spatial encoding and concatenate it with the hash of metric type and hash of timestamp to get the partition key. Then we locate the position of the partition key on the ring and store the key-value pair on the virtual node that covers the corresponding position. In this example, the data-item's partition-key falls between t i+1 and t i+2 , therefore it is stored on the datastore node B (which owns the region between t i+1 and t i+2 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">TTL-based data eviction</head><p>The dependence of real-time analytics on temporally local data renders records older than a certain applicationdependent threshold irrelevant for those queries. However, batch-processing use-cases require data spanning over a large period of time to detect slow-moving patterns. DataFog uses a time-to-live based approach to evict stale data from the edge-nodes, while maintaining replicas in cloud-based nodes. Hence a range query spanning a large interval of time would have to retrieve all concerned data-items from the cloud-based replicas. This prevents accumulation of stale data on constrained edge-nodes, as well as makes complete time-series data available for batch-processing use-cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Data aggregation and compression</head><p>Time series data from sensors is generated periodically and piles up quickly. If each data item (for example, temperature) owns a unique token key, it is likely the metadata will occupy a large portion of storage space and lead to inefficient storage utilization. By aggregating dataitems from the same data source, DataFog is able to save storage space by omitting redundant metadata and also improve the memory locality for range queries. Meanwhile, time series data items from the same data source are usually isomorphic, which leverages the opportunities to further improve the storage utilization by properly compressing both the metadata and the actual data items <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. For example, the air temperature data only fluctuates within a small range, so there is no need to use a full 64-bit integer for each data item, and the difference between subsequent values can be stored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Sketch of System Implementation</head><p>As a first approach towards implementing DataFog, we would extend Apache Cassandra with the aforementioned design decisions. Cassandra uses the hash of dataitem's key to search the hash ring for replicas (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig  1)</ref>. In DataFog the hash function is modified to incorporate spatio-temporal indexing (Section 3.1). A loadbalancing region is composed of data nodes with the same GeoHash prefix (similar positions on hash ring) which forms an arc on the hash ring <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig 1)</ref>. When a load-balancing region is overloaded, application developer can choose to bring in new data nodes or distribute workload across existing nodes. In either case migration of data is involved, where we would leverage the builtin data migration mechanism of Cassandra 2 . A gossip protocol is used to exchange information between nodes and detect failures and network partitions. Network partitions are handled by caching the writes to unavailable nodes and later replaying them when those nodes become available (hinted-handoff). TTL-based data eviction extends Cassandra's existing mechanism to classify data as expired. Data aggregation and compression will be performed as in time-series database engines such as InfluxDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Preliminary Evaluation</head><p>The evaluation of DataFog is intended to delve into the design choices presented in Section 3 and study their effectiveness. In the interest of brevity, we present the results of a preliminary evaluation of a spatio-temportal <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The reader is referred to repair and rebuild operations of Cassandra. https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/ cassandra/tools/toolsRepair.html context-aware data partitioning and replication policy. A more thorough evaluation of DataFog is part of future work and discussed in Section 6. We compare the performance of DataFog's data partitioning policy against the consistent-hashing based policy of off-the-shelf Cassandra. We use the vehicle-tracking use-case described in Section 2 to generate query workload and quantify the performance of spatio-temporal range-queries for recent detections of a particular vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Workload description</head><p>The objective of the vehicle-tracking application is to construct trajectories of vehicles in real-time. We use SUMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to simulate the movement of vehicles on the road network in Georgia Tech campus equipped with 35 smart cameras. These cameras, upon vehicle detection, generate an event with the location, timestamp and license number of the vehicle. For each vehicle detection by a camera, the application submits a range query for all vehicle detections of that vehicle within a 5 kilometre radius that happened less than 10 minutes ago. These previous detections are used to construct vehicle's recent trajectory. The application's performance is contingent on efficient range-query execution. The datastore to store these events and trajectories comprises of 4 nodes within the campus itself and remote nodes in 4 geographically distant regions of the USA (CA, WA, IL and FL). We emulate these nodes and corresponding network topology using MaxiNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> on Microsoft Azure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Implementation details</head><p>We extend Cassandra to build this first prototype of DataFog. To enable context-aware data partitioning, we assign a token to each datastore node, which is composed of a Geohash encoding of the node's location at precision 3 followed by a random byte-sequence 3 . The choice of Geohash precision has been made that all the local nodes (inside Georgia Tech) fall in the same load-balancing region of the hash ring. For simplicity of implementation, we add an additional field called part key to each dataitem that is composed of the data-item's contextual information (as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1)</ref>, and is used for data partitioning. Using this additional field can easily be avoided by implementing a custom context-aware partitioner <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>   The datastore implementation allows millisecond precision for timestamps, and for partitioning events, divides time into 1 hr long chunks -such that any timestamp can be broken down into a chunk with ID ts chunk and an offset ts o f f set. The partition key field part key is composed of the GeoHash of record's location, followed by a consistent hash <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> of the ts chunk field followed by a hash of the metric type field (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>We compare the performance of the preliminary location-based indexing approach to a location-agnostic indexing done by off-the-shelf Cassandra. The replication factor is set to 3. To show the drawback of locationagnostic indexing, we increase the size of the cluster by adding more remote data-store nodes. The latency of spatio-temporal range queries against these replication settings is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. We expect the rangequery latency to increase with an increase in the number of remote nodes, due to off-the-shelf Cassandra's even data partitioning. When the number of remote nodes is less than the replication factor (3), one of the replicas would always be placed on a local node. However, when the number of remote nodes is 3 or greater, some dataitems end up having replicas only on remote nodes making the higher percentiles of latencies becoming higher. DataFog, on the other hand, performs location-aware placement of replicas, and hence is not affected by the increase in cluster size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>The continuous increase in the amount of telemetry data has led design of time-series databases becoming an active area both in research and industry, with a plethora of solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Hughes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> designed GeoMesa, a distributed architecture for spatio-temporal data, which indexes data based on GeoHash and has been built by extending Apache AccumuloDB. The design of indexing keys is similar to DataFog, wherein they incorporate spatial encoding and timestamp by interleaving them. Von et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> discuss the design of a database for storing events concerning objects that change state in space and time using a key-value store HBase. They present the indexing design and highlight important future work. These solutions, however, are built for operation in cloud-based environments, where inter-node latency is significantly smaller than that in edge-computing environments. The concern for having edge-based datastores has been pointed out by Confais et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. They conduct a performance evaluation of three off-the-shelf object stores (Cassandra, Rados and Inter-Planetary File System) in deployed over an edge-computing infrastructure. However, their analysis compares off-the-shelf object stores and they do not make any design decisions suited for the edge computing environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we present the case for a holistic management platform for IoT data on at the network edge. We identify the challenges of edge infrastructure and come up with algorithmic insights for addressing them so as to leverage the benefits of edge-based deployment. Implementation of solutions leveraging those insights and comparing the possible choices from the solution space forms an immediate future work. DataFog's potential is demonstrated by the performance improvement due to a replica placement approach based on spatial locality. Our immediate future work is a thorough quantitative evaluation of the design decisions in comparison to state-ofthe-art Cloud-based datastores.</p><p>The overheads of context-aware partitioning and replication needs to be analyzed. We plan to measure the ability of our load-balancing solutions to manage workloads with inherent skews. We would demonstrate the benefit of eviction-based strategy on utilization of storage resources at the edge. The reduction of storage consumption through data compression and aggregation is another metric that would quantify the performance of DataFog for constrained edge devices. Finally, we would tune the parameters in the aforementioned policies (e.g. replication distance, spatial encoding precision, etc.) and measure their impact on overall performance. Another important issue is the interaction between datastore platforms owned by different stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. There is a need for communication protocols and business models for sharing data across multiple edge administrative domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: This figure exemplifies load-balancing in a Cassandra-specific setting.

Given a data item, we use the location to construct a spatial encoding and concatenate it with the hash of metric type and hash of timestamp to get the partition key.

			<note place="foot" n="3">. Continuous generation of data : Data is generated at all times, thus posing a challenge to the data management platform to cater to the low storage capacity on edge-based nodes. 4. High availability requirements : Applications in the IoT space interact with the environment and perform critical tasks. For reliable operation, the datastore needs to be tolerant to failures, especially geographically correlated failures. 3 Algorithmic Insights for a Geodistributed Datastore Based on the peculiar characteristics of a geo-distributed edge computing infrastructure and applications characteristics mentioned above, we take the following design decisions that will overcome the pitfalls of off-the-shelf platforms. 3.1 Locality-aware distributed indexing Based on the requirements of spatio-temporal locality in range-queries, low-latency response is dependent on the placement of data-items on datastore nodes in proximity to clients. Data-items are indexed based on their spatiotemporal attributes. We propose to use spatio-temporal encoding techniques (e.g. ST-Hash [9]), or a combination of spatial encoding (e.g. Geohash, Hilbert&apos;s encoding [13]) and consistent hashing, for using the location</note>
