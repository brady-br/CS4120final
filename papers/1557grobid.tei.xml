				<p>As critical records are increasingly stored in electronic form, which tends to make for easy destruction and clandestine modification, it is imperative that they be properly managed to preserve their trust-worthiness, i.e., their ability to provide irrefutable proof and accurate details of events that have occurred. The need for proper record keeping is further underscored by the recent corporate misconduct and ensuing attempts to destroy incriminating records. Currently, the industry practice and regulatory requirements (e.g., SEC Rule 17a-4) rely on storing records in WORM storage to immutably preserve the records. In this paper, we contend that simply storing records in WORM storage is increasingly inadequate to ensure that they are trustworthy. Specifically, with the large volume of records that are typical today, meeting the ever more stringent query response time requires the use of direct access mechanisms such as indexes. Relying on indexes for accessing records could, however, provide a means for effectively altering or deleting records, even those stored in WORM storage. In this paper, we establish the key requirements for a fossilized index that protects the records from such logical modification. We also analyze current indexing methods to determine how they fall short of these requirements. Based on our insights, we propose the Generalized Hash Tree (GHT). Using both theoretical analysis and simulations with real system data, we demonstrate that the GHT can satisfy the requirements of a fossilized index with performance and cost that are comparable to regular indexing techniques such as the B-tree. We further note that as records are indexed on multiple fields to facilitate search and retrieval, the records can be reconstructed from the corresponding index entries even after the records expire and are disposed of. Therefore, we also present a novel method to eliminate this disclosure risk by allowing an index entry to be effectively disposed of when its record expires.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TRUSTWORTHY RECORD KEEPING</head><p>The fundamental purpose of record keeping is to establish solid proof and accurate details of events that have occurred. Trustworthy records are, therefore, those that can be relied upon to achieve this purpose. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, we make the case that trustworthiness has to be established from an end-to-end perspective, i.e., from when the records are created to when they are actually used by an agent conducting an audit, a legal or regulatory discovery, an internal investigation, etc. We further develop a process called fossilization for achieving end-to-end trust in record keeping. Here, we briefly outline some of the key ideas in fossilization.</p><p>The process of creating accurate records for all of the relevant events as they occur is generally trusted. This is the case especially if the records are used in the normal course of business, and are hence required for the proper functioning of the organization. Furthermore, record creation is an ongoing process for which periodic audits are effective in ensuring proper execution. More importantly, it is extremely unlikely that one can anticipate at record creation time how a record could be modified for personal gain. In any case, if one is privy to such knowledge, one would arguably be better off trying to infiuence the events themselves. The basic objective of record keeping is not to prevent the writing of history, but to prevent the changing of history; in other words, changing the records after the fact. Therefore, the key requirement for trustworthy record keeping is to ensure that in an enquiry, all of the relevant records can be quickly located and retrieved in an untampered form. This means that the records have to be protected from any physical modification during their storage. Modification of records could result from user errors, such as issuing the wrong commands and replacing the wrong disks, and from software bugs. Given our increasing reliance on computer records, the potential gain from manipulating and modifying the records is huge. Thus, more importantly, the records have to be protected from intentional attacks, even inside attacks launched by disgruntled employees, company insiders, or conspiring technology experts. An adversary is likely to have the highest (e.g., executive) level of support and insider access, privilege and knowledge. He can be thought of as the super system administrator. Although the adversary has physical access to the records, he cannot destroy them in a blatant fashion because it would result in severe penalties and even the presumption of guilt. His mission is to clandestinely hide or modify specific records.</p><p>Typically, the records are stored in some form of WORM storage to protect them from modification. With the growing volume of records and the ever more stringent response time to enquiries, direct access mechanisms such as indexes increasingly have to be maintained to ensure that all of the records relevant to an enquiry can be discovered and retrieved in a timely fashion, typically within days and sometimes even within hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. As illustrated earlier in  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, however, if records are accessed through an index, even if they are stored in WORM storage, they will still be vulnerable to logical modification if the index can be suitably manipulated. In particular, an adversarial system administrator could write carefully crafted data to the WORM storage to subvert the index and logically hide or modify selected records. He could, for example, fake an adjustment to the index structure (e.g. tree rebalance), which would enable him to omit crucial records from the new structure. He could also prevent timely access to crucial records by causing the index to degenerate (e.g. by inserting carefully chosen spurious records).</p><p>The linchpin of trustworthy records is, therefore, a fossilized index that ensures that once a record is preserved in WORM storage, it is accessible in an unaltered form and in a timely fashion. The key properties for such an index are as follows:</p><p>• Once a record is committed, both the index entry for that record and the path to that entry must be immutable. Specifically, the insertion of a new record into the system must not in any way affect how previously inserted records are accessed through that index. This means that once the insertion of a record into the index has been committed to WORM storage, the record is guaranteed to be accessible through that index unless the WORM storage is compromised. In other words, the accessibility of the record is dependent only on the non-rewritability of the WORM storage.</p><p>• The index must support incremental growth and be able to scale to extremely large collections of records to support the rapidly growing volume of records.</p><p>• Records must be quickly accessible through the index when events such as investigation or litigation occurs. The index must not, for example, degenerate into requiring a linear scan.</p><p>• The space overhead of the index must be acceptable. Although storage has become relatively inexpensive with the rapid improvement in disk areal density, with the large volume of records typical today, storage efficiency is still a major consideration. This is the case especially because there is a tendency in the short term to view some of the record keeping largely as an overhead needed just for satisfying the current intense regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>• The index should support selective disposition of index entries to ensure that expired records cannot be recovered or reconstituted from the index entries, even with the use of data forensics.</p><p>Note that a fossilized index must be used for any trusted means of finding and accessing a record. Examples of such include the file system directory which allows records to be located by the file name, the database index which enables records to be retrieved based on the value of some specified field or combination of fields, and the full-text index which allows records containing some particular words or phrases to be found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">INSIGHTS FROM PREVIOUS WORK</head><p>There is a lot of previous work on indexing techniques, including several focused on effective indexing methods for WORM storage. For the most part, these indexing techniques for WORM storage were motivated by the desire to store data on optical disks, which at that time had an advantage over magnetic disks in terms of cost and storage capacity. Thus, they were designed mainly for storage and operational efficiency, and not for trustworthy record keeping.</p><p>Index in Rewritable Storage: In this approach, the records are stored in WORM storage while the index structures are stored in rewritable storage (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. Clearly, regardless of the type of index used, an adversary can easily modify the index to cause records to be effectively hidden or altered.</p><p>Copy on Rebalance: A balanced tree can be maintained in WORM storage simply by making a new copy of the tree each time an insertion occurs. The time and space overhead of this approach is, however, prohibitive. A straightforward optimization used to realize persistent search trees is to copy only the nodes that are involved in rebalancing the tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref>. Because any node that contains a pointer to a node that is copied must itself be copied, copying a node requires copying the entire path to the node from the root of the tree. Thus this method is called "path copying". As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>(a), the effect of this method is to create a set of search trees having different roots but sharing common subtrees. If an index entry is omitted or counterfeited during path copy, the corresponding record could be effectively deleted or modified. More importantly, an adversary could modify records at will by exploiting this provision for creating new paths to any node. Note that even if all of the previous versions of the tree are preserved in WORM storage, probing each in an effort to guard against tampering is impractical.</p><p>Grow from Leaves Up: One way to avoid having to rebalance the tree is to grow the tree from the leaves up to the root. For example, in write-once B-tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2(b)</ref>), a node is split into two new nodes when it overflows. Two pointers are added to the end of its parent node, superseding the earlier pointer to the old node. If the parent node overflows, it is split as well and only the most recent pointers are copied. When the root node splits, a new root is created. Such a design allows an adversary to effectively modify any record he wishes to by creating a new version of the appropriate nodes. Again, even if every alteration of the nodes is preserved in WORM storage, it is infeasible to look up each version of the tree to defend against tampering. The same issue applies to the multiversion B-tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and the append-only trie <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>(c)).</p><p>Relocate to Grow: In dynamic hashing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9]</ref> and its extensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), when the number of records in a hash table exceeds a high watermark, a new hash table with a larger size is allocated and all the records are rehashed and moved into the new table. In this way, dynamic data growth can be supported with good performance. The ability to relocate records, however, clearly provides an opportunity for an adversary to alter the records. The trie proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which stores records in the leaf nodes and moves records to new leaf nodes as the trie grows, suffers similar exposure. Dynamic hashing can, in principle, be adapted to defeat logical modification of records by, for example, storing all versions of the hash table in WORM storage and probing each of the versions on a lookup. Later in Section 4.2, we will consider an optimized adaptation that prevents any logical modification of records and that does not require duplicating entries and probing all the hash tables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">GHT: GENERALIZED HASH TREE</head><p>Although the previous indexing methods for WORM storage fall short of what is required to achieve a fossilized index, they provide valuable insights into how to design one. First, any approach that requires the rebalancing of a tree is vulnerable to compromise because it inevitably allows an adversary to create new paths to records. Second, trees that grow from the leaves up to the root are similarly exposed because an adversary could modify records at will by exploiting the provision for creating new versions of the tree nodes. Third, any method that permits index entries to be relocated is inherently not trustworthy because it opens the door for an adversary to create new versions of any entry.</p><p>Therefore, a fossilized index essentially requires that we design:</p><p>• a tree that grows from the root down to the leaves without relocating committed entries and that is balanced without requiring dynamic adjustments to its structure.</p><p>• efficient dynamic hashing schemes that do not require rehashing.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a fossilized index method based on a novel data structure called the Generalized Hash Tree (GHT). The GHT is effectively a tree that grows from the root down to the leaves and that is balanced without requiring any dynamic rebalancing. Attempts to insert or lookup a record are made beginning at the root node of the tree and if unsuccessful, the process is repeated at one or more of its children subtrees. When a record cannot be inserted into any of the existing nodes, a new node is created and added to the tree as a leaf. At each level, the possible locations for inserting the record are determined by a hash of the record key. Consequently, the possible locations of a record in the tree are fixed and determined solely by that record. Moreover, inserted records are never rehashed or relocated. We consider the tree "generalized" because it represents a family of hash trees. By using different parameters and hash functions, we achieve hash trees with different characteristics.</p><p>We first discuss the design of the GHT in Section 4.1 and describe four instances -thin tree, fat tree, multi-level hash table and hash trie -in Section 4.2. In Section 4.3, we present theoretical analysis of the GHT's performance and cost, and in Section 4.4, we consider several optimizations. We assume that the underlying storage supports reads from and writes to a random location, and ensures that any data that has been written cannot be overwritten, at least for a specified period. This assumption is in line with the current industry trend of providing WORM storage using magnetic disks (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>). For improved storage efficiency, it is preferred that the storage has a small write granularity, which can be achieved, for example, by allowing data to be appended to a sector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">General Design</head><p>To make our presentation precise, we first define some terms.</p><p>1. We consider only single key retrieval in which a record is represented by a key and a pointer to the actual data.</p><p>2. A bucket is an entry in a tree node to store a record.</p><p>3. A tree node consists of buckets and is the basic allocation unit of a tree. The size of a tree node may vary with its level in the tree. Let M = {m0, m1, m2, ...} where mi is the size of a tree node at level i. To reduce clutter, if the size of the tree node is constant across the levels, we denote it by m.</p><p>4. A growth factor, ki, denotes that the tree may have ki times as many buckets at level (i + 1) as at level i. The growth factor may vary for each level. Let K = {k0, k1, k2, ...} where ki is the growth factor for level i. We denote the growth factor by k if it is constant across the levels.</p><p>5. Let H = {h0, h1, h2, ...} denote a set of hash functions where hi is the hash function for level i.</p><p>A GHT is defined by the tuple {M, K, H}. When traversing the GHT, the candidate buckets, i.e., the target hash table, at a given level is composed of the children of the node at which the collision occurred at the previous level. The root node is itself a hash table.</p><p>There are three criteria to consider when choosing the hash functions, H. First, they should be independent to reduce the chances that records colliding at one level of the tree will also collide at the next. Second, they should be efficient to calculate. Third, they should be insensitive to the size of the target range. In this paper, we use universal hash functions defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h(x) = ((ax + b)mod p)mod r,</formula><p>where p is a prime chosen such that all the possible keys are less than p, r is the size of the target range, a ∈ {1, 2, ..., p − 1}, and b ∈ {0, 1, 2, ..., p − 1}. The hash function for each level is selected randomly at the time the level is created by picking random values for a and b. Using randomly selected hash functions prevents the GHT from degenerating largely into a list on specific inputs and allows it to achieve provably good performance on average.</p><p>To insert a record, we use the procedure TREE-INSERT. Given a pointer to the root of a tree, t, and a record, x, TREE-INSERT returns SUCCESS if the insertion succeeds and FAILURE if a record with the same key already exists in the tree. Given a key, we calculate the target bucket at a given level by using the corresponding hash function. The target range of the hash function or, in other words, the size of the hash table at a given level, is determined by GetHashTableSize(). GetNode() gives the tree node which holds the bucket and GetIndex() returns the index of the bucket in that tree node. Depending on how these functions are defined, we can realize a family of GHTs. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> lists some sample instantiations of these functions for the various hash trees we will describe in section 4.2. <ref type="table">Table  m0</ref> × k i 0 j   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the insertion of a record into a tree where m = 4, k = 2 and H is as defined earlier. Let us assume that (h0, h1, h2, h3)(key) = (1, 6, 1, 3) and use (level, node, index) to denote a bucket. We first try to insert the record into the root node. However, the target bucket (0,0,1) is not empty. Next, we try again in the hash table at the next level, which is formed by the two children nodes of the root. h1(key) = 6 indicates that the target bucket is (1, 1, 2) which is not empty either. Since the collision happens in node 1, its two children nodes form the nextlevel hash table. Unfortunately, the next attempt collides in the bucket (2,0,1). The fourth attempt succeeds since the tree node containing the target bucket does not exist. We allocate a new tree node and insert the record into the bucket <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(3,0,3)</ref>. Intuitively, if the hash functions are uniform, the tree grows from the root down in a balanced fashion. We will prove this assertion of balanced growth later in Section 4.3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">GetHashTableSize(i) GetNode(i, j) GetIndex(i, j) Thin Tree (Hash Trie) m (if i = 0); m × k (if i 񮽙 = 0) j div m j mod m Fat Tree m × k i j div m j mod m Multi-Level Hash</formula><p>The procedure TREE-SEARCH lists the steps to retrieve a record given its key. The procedure returns the record if it exists in the tree Algorithm 2 TREE-SEARCH(t, key) 1: i ← 0; p ← t.root; index ← h0(key)</p><note type="other">2: loop 3: if node p does not exist then 4: return NULL 5: end if 6: if p[index] is empty then 7: return NULL 8: end if 9: if p[index].key = key then 10: return p[index] 11: end if 12: i ← i+1 {Go to the next tree level} 13: j ← GetNode(i, hi(key)) 14: p ← p.child[j] 15:</note><p>index ← GetIndex(i, hi(key)) 16: end loop and NULL otherwise. When a target bucket is full, we test if its key matches the search key. If they match, then the record is found; otherwise we follow the same process as in insertion to probe the next level of the tree. When a target bucket is empty or the target tree node has not been allocated, the search fails.</p><p>We do not consider deletion here but will discuss disposition of index entries in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Case Studies</head><p>The GHT is actually a family of hash trees. The members differ in the way the tree is organized. Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses. In this section, we discuss four representative cases: thin tree, fat tree, multi-level hash table and hash trie. Their tree-specific functions are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Thin Tree: Thin trees are standard trees in which each node has a fixed size, a fixed number of children nodes, and at most one parent node. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>(a) depicts a thin tree with m = 4 and k = 2. Earlier in Section 4.1, we used such a thin tree to illustrate the record insertion operation. Thin trees can be implemented with each node containing m buckets and k pointers to its children nodes.</p><p>If the hash functions are uniform and independent, a new record is equally likely to follow any path from the root to a leaf node. Thus, thin trees grow from the root down in a balanced fashion. The expected depth of the tree is O(log(n)) where n is the number of records. The most attractive property of thin trees is its linearly bounded space cost. Since a node is allocated only when a record is about to be inserted into it, each node contains at least one record. The space cost is thus O(m × n) in the worst case.</p><p>Fat Tree: The fat tree is a hash tree in which each node has multiple parents. The fatness indicates how many parents each node can have. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4(b)</ref> shows a fully fat tree where all the nodes at the level above a node are its parents. For simplicity, we discuss only fully fat trees and refer to them simply as fat trees. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>(b), m = 4 and k = 2, as is the case in the thin tree example. The  <ref type="table">table size</ref> is m × k i for each level i. In other words, when a collision occurs, the record can be inserted into any node at the next level.</p><p>If the hash functions are uniform and independent, fat trees behave similar to thin trees and, thus, the expected tree depth is also O(log(n)). However, in reality, it is difficult to ensure that the hash functions are exactly uniform. One advantage of fat trees is that they can tolerate non-ideal hash functions better than thin trees because they have many more potential target buckets at each level.</p><p>Another advantage of fat trees is that the hashing at different levels is actually independent. In thin trees, the target hash table at a given level is dependent on the node at which the collision occurred at the previous level. In contrast, all the nodes at the same level in a fat tree form the target hash table. Therefore, if we locate each level of a fat tree in a different disk, we can access these levels in parallel using their corresponding hash functions.</p><p>In implementing fat trees, since the number of children node increases exponentially with the level in the tree, it is expensive in space to maintain the children pointers for each node. As the children of a node are the same as those of its peers, we maintain an extra array for each level to track whether a tree node is allocated and if so, its location. <ref type="table">Table:</ref> If we double the size of the tree nodes at each level, and still set the growth factor, k, to be 2, we end up with the multi-level hash table shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>(c). In this case, mi = m0×k i where m0 is the size of the root node. For simplicity, however, we still use m = 4 to denote the structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-Level Hash</head><p>The hash functions are the same as those of the corresponding fat trees. Therefore, the multi-level hash table has the same tree depth as the corresponding fat tree for a given insertion sequence. Access to the multi-level hash table can also be parallelized.</p><p>The multi-level hash table has the advantage of simplicity. However, a collision in the leaf may lead to the allocation of a large chunk of space -k times as large as the current leaf. As a result, the space usage of the multi-level hash table grows much faster than that of the fat tree, as we shall see in Section 6.</p><p>Hash Trie: If we hash the key of a record and store the record in a trie based on this hash value, we obtain the hash trie. For example, suppose that the size of a trie node is 256 buckets, which means that the fan-out is 256. We use 8 bits of the hash value as an index to the target bucket at each level. If the target bucket is empty, the record is inserted; otherwise, we proceed to the subtrie pointed to by the index and use the next 8 bits of the hash value as a new index. To reduce the chances of collisions, a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> can be used.</p><p>In essence, a hash trie is a special case of the thin tree where m and k are equal and a power of 2. The sample trie above is a thin tree with m = k = 256. The corresponding hash functions are as follows: at the first level, use the first 8 bits of the hashed record key as the hash value; at the second level, use bits 0-15 as the hash value; at the third level, use bits 8-23; and so on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Theoretical Analysis Figure 5: A Full Thin Tree with a Depth of Clog k n</head><p>Theorem I: The expected tree depth of a GHT is O(log k n). Proof: First, we consider a thin tree where m = 1. We construct a full thin tree with a depth of Clog k n where C ≥ 3 and n is the number of records. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows such a tree. We use this tree to establish a bound on the probability that an initially empty thin tree will become deeper than Clog k n after n insertions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Optimizations</head><p>In this section, we discuss several optimization techniques to further reduce the time and space costs.</p><p>Linear Probing: A potential shortcoming of hash trees is that, in the worst case, each tree node might have only a few buckets that are occupied, resulting in low space utilization. To improve the situation for thin trees and fat trees, we apply linear probing within a tree node. When a collision occurs in a tree node, we linearly search the other buckets within the node before probing the next level in the tree. Specifically, at each level i, we use the following series of hash functions: hi(j, key) = (hi(key) + j) mod m , where j = 1, 2, ..., m − 1. For the multi-level hash table, we introduce the concept of "virtual node". The single tree node at each level is divided into fixed-size virtual nodes and we probe linearly within the virtual nodes.</p><p>As we shall see later in Section 6, with linear probing, empty buckets appear only in the leaf nodes and space utilization is, therefore, improved significantly. Meanwhile, average access time remains logarithmic in the number of records. In practice, linear probing incurs little overhead because it uses large block I/O, which effectively leverages the high sequential transfer rate of modern storage devices. Other hash table optimizations such as double hashing can also be applied to the hash tree. <ref type="table">Table:</ref> In hash trees, the first level hash table is, by default, the root node. Unless the tree node is huge, this makes the tree unnecessarily deep, which reduces performance. One optimization is to decouple the first-level hash table from the root node to allow the first-level hash table to comprise a number of tree nodes. In other words, we effectively remove the first few levels of the basic hash tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Large First-Level Hash</head><p>In section 6, we evaluate the effect of increasing the first-level hash table size. Ideally, the first-level hash table should be large enough to allow efficient insertion and retrieval but small enough to avoid over-provisioning.</p><p>Parallel Access: As discussed in Section 4.1, for thin trees, including hash tries, the target hash table at a given level depends on the node at which the collision occurred at the previous level. On the other hand, for fat trees and multi-level hash tables, the hashing at each level is independent. Therefore, if we have multiple disks and we locate each level of a fat tree or multi-level hash table on a different disk, we can access all the levels in parallel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">DISPOSITION OF INDEX ENTRIES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Problem Statement</head><p>As discussed earlier, it is crucial for an organization to properly dispose of records that are no longer useful to the organization and have passed any mandated retention periods. Otherwise, the records are subject to discovery, and typically at great expense to the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. Proper disposition of records include deleting the records. In some cases, the records have to be shredded such that they cannot be recovered or discovered even with the use of data forensics. Such disposition can be achieved by physical destruction of the storage. For disk-based WORM storage (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>), an alternative is to overwrite the data multiple times with specific patterns so as to completely erase remnant magnetic effects which could otherwise enable the data to be recovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>.</p><p>However, as records are indexed on multiple fields to facilitate search and retrieval, the records can be reconstructed from the corresponding index entries even after the records expire and are disposed of. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>(a) shows an inverted index <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> consisting of a dictionary (e.g., a GHT) of words occurring in a set of documents and posting lists, which contain information about the occurrence of the words such as the record locator (e.g., ID of documents containing the words, pointer to the documents) and, in some cases, positional information (e.g., offset within the documents). By performing a join on the record locator in the posting lists, we can discover that the document X contains both the words "Sell" and "IMCL". If this is a full-text index, the whole document can be reconstructed from the index even after the document has been disposed of. Thus, it is imperative to dispose of all the index entries associated with a record when the record is disposed of. An arbitrary index entry, however, cannot typically be disposed of together with its record because the unit of disposition tends to be much larger than the unit of writing. Data stored on a WORM optical disc, for example, is regularly disposed of by physically destroying the entire disc. In disk-based WORM storage, some metadata such as the expiration date must be kept for each unit of disposition. To reduce the amount of metadata required, the disposition unit is, therefore, large. In general, an index entry is likely to be much smaller than a disposition unit, meaning that an index entry cannot be disposed of until all the other entries within the disposition unit have expired. Because index entries are organized based on the index key and are not clustered on the expiration date, there tends to be a long period during which information about a record that has already been disposed of can potentially be discovered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Scrambled Keys</head><p>A straightforward way to prevent a record from being reconstructed from its index entries is to scramble the keys before inserting them into the index. Specifically, to insert a record into the index, we hash the index key of the record and use the hash value as the key for inserting the record into the index. With a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>, it is computationally infeasible to recreate a key from its hash value. Thus, we can simply dispose of an expired record and leave behind its index entries.</p><p>This approach is, however, vulnerable to existence testing. For instance, if one is looking for a document containing a few specific terms, one can hash the terms and search the index entries for those specific hash values. Another weakness is that this method does not work when the key space is small. In this case, one can effectively create a reverse map for the hash values of all the keys without having to break the one-way hash. For example, it is not difficult to find the SHA-1 hash value for all the words in the English language, which total only about 616,500 words <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Logical Disposition</head><p>Therefore, we introduce a more general technique called logical disposition to allow the index entries associated with expired records to be effectively disposed of. In this method, records are classified into disposition groups by, for example, their expiration date. For each disposition group, we generate encoding and decoding functions. These functions are stored by themselves in one or more disposition units so that they can be individually disposed of when the records in the corresponding disposition group expire.</p><p>The encoding function is used to transform the record locators, which are then stored in the index. The decoding function decodes the stored record locators so that they can be used to locate the record. When a group of records is disposed of, the functions of that group are also disposed of.</p><p>In the indirect pointer method, the encoding and decoding functions are realized through expiration control blocks (ECBs) which introduce a level of indirection in the record locators. Instead of storing the record locator directly in the index, we store an indirect pointer to an entry in the ECB where the record locator is actually stored. Each ECB serves as an indirect table for records that are in the same disposition group. In the above example, the record locators corresponding to "Sell" and "IMCL" in document X would each point to a different entry in the same ECB and both of these entries would point to document X <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 6(b)</ref>). When the group of records which include document X is disposed of, the associated ECB is also disposed of. After the ECB is disposed of, the only information that could be uncovered is that the words "Sell" and "IMCL" belong to documents that were disposed of together. As added security, we can introduce spurious records so that each disposition group has a minimum number of records. Note that we only need to store the metadata for the spurious records; the records themselves do not have to be instantiated. The drawback of this method is the space needed for the ECBs, which essentially duplicate the record locators.</p><p>In the second method, we use encryption and decryption (e.g., AES <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>) to realize the encoding and decoding functions. For each disposition group, we generate and maintain a secret key. Basically, each record locator is first encrypted using the secret key corresponding to its disposition group before it is stored in the index. To avoid having the same cyphertext for each occurrence of a particular record locator, which would enable an adversary to reconstruct the record by performing a join on the cyphertext, we encrypt the combination of the index key and the record locator. When a group of records is disposed of, the associated secret key is also disposed of. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6(c)</ref> shows such an example. Note that after the secret key is disposed of, an adversary can still determine that the words "Sell" and "IMCL" belong to documents in the same disposition group since the index entries for these words identify the same secret key. As in the indirect pointer method, spurious records can be introduced so that each disposition group has a minimum number of records. Furthermore, for the encryption method, it is feasible to conceal membership in a disposition group by duplicating the secret keys and randomly selecting which copy of a key to identify in an index entry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">SIMULATION RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Methodology</head><p>In order to understand the actual cost of a fossilized index, we use simulation with real system data to compare the GHT with several traditional indexing methods including the k-way tree, rewritable B-tree and ideal tree. For the GHT, we present results for the thin tree, fat tree and multi-level hash table. Since the hash trie is a special case of the thin tree, we do not explicitly show its results. In most cases, it behaves exactly like the generic thin tree.</p><p>The k-way tree is a tree in which each node contains k − 1 keys and k pointers to its children. The pointers and keys are arranged in an alternate fashion such that the subtrees to the left of a key contain only keys that are smaller while the subtrees to the right of a key contain only keys that are larger. The B-tree is a balanced variant of the k-way tree. All the leaves in a B-tree are on the same level and all the nodes except for the root and the leaves have at least k/2 children. The rewritable B-tree splits a node that overflows in place and is, hence, much more space-efficient than its writeonce counterpart. The ideal tree is a k-way tree that is constructed offline with knowledge of all the keys so that it has perfect balance and space utilization. Its results represent the lower bound.</p><p>The two metrics that we focus on are the average tree depth and space cost. Since storage has become relatively inexpensive, the space cost has become less of an issue. Nevertheless, with the large volume of records typical today, it is still important to ensure that the space overhead is not excessively high. The average tree depth is a critical determinant of insertion and access performance. It is defined as 1/n P n i=1 depth(i), where n is the number of records and depth(x) denotes the depth of the x-th key in the tree.</p><p>We use two sets of real system data. Zeus2 is a snapshot of a file system used by a group of researchers to do compilation, text editing and software development. Mainstore is a data set created by web crawling and includes the URLs of all of the internal websites of a large corporation. In total, Zeus2 contains 975,861 files while Mainstore includes 5,130,881 URLs. Between them, the data sets are likely to be illustrative of a variety of applications, including those targeted by the GHT. For each file and URL, we create a unique 64-bit key by using SHA-1. In this paper, we present only the results for Zeus2 since the results for Mainstore are virtually identical. The simulations were performed on an IBM xSeries model 325 server with a 64-bit AMD Opteron processor. We use eight bytes for the length of both a key and a pointer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Sensitivity to Size of Tree Node</head><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, we present how the average tree depth and space cost of the GHTs are affected as m, the size of the tree node (root node for the multi-level hash table), is increased. Since a larger m means that there are more buckets at each level, the space cost rises with m while the average tree depth decreases. Observe from <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>(a) that, largely independent of changes in m, the average tree depth of the GHTs is consistently within two of that of the ideal tree, indicating that the GHTs are very well-balanced.</p><p>From <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>(b), as m increases, the space cost for the multilevel hash table increases faster as records are added, but remains in a stable state for a longer period of time. The thin and fat trees exhibit similar behavior, but their increase in space cost happens more smoothly <ref type="figure">(Figure 7(c)</ref>). The plots for the fat and thin trees are almost overlapped because, in practice, the pointer array of the fat tree incurs little overhead due to the small tree depth. In general, a large m is preferred since it decreases the average tree depth without increasing the space cost by very much. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> presents the sensitivity of the GHTs to the growth factor, k. As expected, the space cost increases with the growth factor while the average tree depth decreases. Notice that compared to the ideal tree, the GHTs have, on average, only about two more levels. If space is not a very big constraint, as is likely to be the case, a large k is preferred. Otherwise, a small k would lead to reasonable access performance with small space cost. In the next section, we present the results of linear probing within a tree node (virtual node for multi-level hash table) and show that it can significantly improve both space efficiency and access performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Sensitivity to First-Level Hash Table Size</head><p>A large first-level hash table effectively means that the first few upper tree levels are removed. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 9</ref>, we can use a large first-level hash table to significantly reduce the average tree depth and access time without adversely affecting the space cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Effect of Linear Probing</head><p>Figures 10(a) and <ref type="bibr">10(d)</ref> show that for GHTs with linear probing within a node, the average tree depth is almost the same as that of the ideal tree, implying that the GHTs are perfectly balanced.  , we find that for k = 8, the space used is lessened by 60 times with linear probing. Moreover, linear probing is well suited to exploit the high sequential transfer rate of modern storage devices by bringing large chucks of data into memory at a time.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Fur-¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¡ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¢ £ ¢ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ § £ § § £ § § £ § § £ § § £ § § £ § § £ § § £ § § £ § ¨ £ ¨ ¨ £ ¨ ¨ £ ¨ ¨ £ ¨ ¨ £ ¨ ¨ £ ¨ ¨ £ ¨ ¨ £ ¨ © © © © © © © © © £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ £ ! £ ! ! £ ! ! £ ! ! £ !

This is because, with linear probing, a child node is generated only when its parent node becomes full. Therefore, the tree grows in a level-by-level fashion. If the hash functions are uniform, the records tend to be well distributed so that the thin and fat trees end up allocating all the nodes in a level within a short period of time. Notice further that the effect of the parameters are qualitatively similar with or without linear probing, but the scales are different: with larger m, the space cost increases faster as records are inserted, but remains in a stable state for longer; trees grow deeper faster when k is large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6">Comparison Results</head><p>In this section, we compare the GHTs with space optimization (linear probing within a node) to the rewritable B-tree, k-way tree and ideal tree. In order to establish a common basis for comparison, we set the size of the tree node, m, to be equal to the growth factor, k, which is a non-optimal configuration for the GHTs. The results for the average tree depth are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Note that the k-way tree is able to prevent logical modification of records, but it has by far the worst tree depth. Since the k-way tree does not rebalance itself, its depth is determined solely by the insertion sequence of records. The B-tree, on the other hand, performs well but is vulnerable to logical tampering of records. The GHTs are able to satisfy the requirements of a fossilized index and yet perform equal or up to 12.5% better than the B-tree. In all cases, the GHTs are very close to the ideal tree in terms of the average tree depth. This indicates that hashing works very well in practice. As a result, the GHTs are well-balanced, implying good search and access performance. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> presents the comparison of space cost for k = m = 4, 16 and 64. We zoom in on some of the plots in order to provide a more detailed picture of the behavior. For k = m = 4, the space cost of the multi-level hash table grows much faster than that of the other trees. This is because it takes only one collision in the leaf node to trigger the allocation of a large chunk of space -four times larger than the current leaf node. In contrast, the space cost of the thin and fat trees with linear probing is comparable to that of the Btree. In fact, the thin tree has an advantage in space efficiency over the B-tree that exceeds 10%. The small jumps in the curve of the fat tree are caused by the allocation of space for the pointer array whenever the tree grows by a level. As k and m are increased, the thin and fat trees become less space-efficient than the B-tree. This is because with uniform hashing, the records at the bottom level tend to be well distributed among all the leaf nodes so that many leaf nodes are allocated with each containing only a few records. A small k with a large first-level hash table is generally preferred for the GHTs. When thus configured, the GHTs incur reasonable space cost and offers very good performance, thereby showing that a fossilized index can be achieved in a practical manner.</p><p>The GHT has been prototyped and implemented to handle the file directory of a large SAN (storage area network) file system. The performance achieved is in line with our expectations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>Having trustworthy records, i.e., records capable of providing irrefutable proof and accurate details of events that have occurred, is critical to an organization. In this paper, we contend that the current limited focus of storing electronic records in WORM storage is far from adequate to ensure that they are trustworthy. In particular, we demonstrate that the records stored in WORM storage can be logically modified if the index through which the records are accessed can be suitably manipulated. With the increasingly large volume of records and the ever more stringent response time to enquiries, the index poses a large and looming risk. The rising threat of adverse discovery further makes it imperative to dispose of records that are no longer needed. However, unless the corresponding index entries are also properly disposed of, the disposed of records can in effect be reconstructed from the index entries.</p><p>Therefore, we identify the key requirements for a fossilized index that prevents the records from being logically modified. We also analyze how current indexing methods, including those designed for WORM storage, fall short of these requirements. Based on the insights we gained, we propose the Generalized Hash Tree (GHT) as an effective approach to achieving a fossilized index. The GHT represents a family of hash trees, including the thin tree, fat tree, multi-level hash table and hash trie. We further present a novel technique called logical disposition that enables the effective disposition of index entries corresponding to records that have been disposed of so as to prevent the records from being reconstructed.</p><p>Using both theoretical analysis and simulations with real system data, we show that the GHT offers high performance at a low storage cost. Specifically, the expected tree depth of the GHT is logarithmic in the number of records indexed and, in practice, the GHT is very well-balanced. Furthermore, with optimizations such as linear probing, its space cost is comparable with that of the B-tree. In short, the GHT enables fossilized index with performance and cost that are comparable to traditional indexing techniques, indicating that trustworthy electronic records can be effectively achieved. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Non-Fossilized Index Allows Logical Modification.
