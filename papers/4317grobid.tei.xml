			<abstract>
				<p>SpecFuzz is the first tool that enables dynamic testing for speculative execution vulnerabilities (e.g., Spectre). The key is a novel concept of speculation exposure: The program is instrumented to simulate speculative execution in software by forcefully executing the code paths that could be triggered due to mispredictions, thereby making the speculative memory accesses visible to integrity checkers (e.g., AddressSanitizer). Combined with the conventional fuzzing techniques, speculation exposure enables more precise identification of potential vulnerabilities compared to state-of-the-art static analyzers. Our prototype for detecting Spectre V1 vulnerabilities successfully identifies all known variations of Spectre V1 and decreases the mitigation overheads across the evaluated applications , reducing the amount of instrumented branches by up to 77% given a sufficient test coverage.</p>

It is a microarchitectural attack, an attack where a malicious actor extracts secrets by exploiting security flaws in the CPU architecture rather than in software. Such attacks are particularly dangerous as they compromise the security of bug-free programs.</p><p>Spectre-type microarchitectural attacks exploit branch speculations to access victim's memory. For example, if an array access is guarded by an index bounds check, the CPU branch predictor might speculate that the check will pass and thus perform the memory access before the index is validated. If the speculation turns out to be wrong, the CPU rolls back the respective changes in the architectural state (e.g., in registers), but it does not cleanse its microarchitectural state (e.g., cached data). Spectre-type attacks use this property to exfiltrate the results of computations executed on this mispredicted path.</p><p>Unfortunately, many variants of Spectre hardware vulnerabilities are not expected to be fixed by hardware vendors, most notably Intel <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref>. Therefore, the burden of protecting programs lies entirely on software developers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[40]</ref>.</p><p>This observation led to the development of software tools for Spectre mitigation. They identify the code snippets purported to be vulnerable to the Spectre attacks and instrument them to prevent or eliminate unsafe speculation. Inherently, the instrumentation incurs runtime overheads, thereby leading to the apparent tradeoff between security and performance.</p><p>Currently, all the existing tools exercise only the extreme points in this tradeoff, offering either poor performance with high security, or poor security with high performance.</p><p>Specifically, conservative techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">53]</ref> pessimistically harden every speculatable instruction (e.g., every conditional branch) to either prevent the speculation or make it provably benign. This approach is secure, but may significantly hurt program performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[44]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, static analysis tools <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">41</ref>] reduce the performance costs by instrumenting only known Spectre gadgets-the code patterns that are typical for the attacks. However, the analysis is imprecise and may overlook vulnerabilities, either because the vulnerable code does not match the expected patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref>, or due to the limitations of the analysis itself (e.g., considers each function only in isolation).</p><p>We seek to build a tool that exercises a different point on the security-performance tradeoff curve by eliding unnecessary instrumentation without restricting ourselves to specific gadgets. Arguably, a key challenge is to precisely identify vulnerable code regions, yet this task is hard to achieve via static analysis. Instead, in this work we harness dynamic testing (e.g., fuzzing) to detect Spectre-type vulnerabilities.</p><p>Fuzzing <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[63]</ref> is a well-established testing technique. The basic idea of fuzzing is simple: Add integrity checks to the tested software (e.g., with AddressSanitizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref>) and feed it with randomized inputs to find cases that trigger a bug. This technique is commonly used to detect stability issues and memory errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[50]</ref>.</p><p>In principle, Spectre-type attacks effectively perform unauthorized accesses to data via out-of-bound reads, thus they are supposed to be caught via fuzzing. Unfortunately, this is not the case because the accesses are invoked speculatively, on a mispredicted path, therefore are discarded by hardware without being exposed to software. As a result, they remain invisible to runtime integrity checkers.</p><p>We introduce speculation exposure, the first technique to enable dynamic testing for Spectre-type vulnerabilities. Speculation exposure leverages software simulation of speculative paths to turn speculative vulnerabilities into conventional ones and, thus, make them detectable by memory safety checkers. The concept is generic and can be applied to different Spectre attacks.</p><p>Speculation exposure consists of four phases executed for every speculatable instruction: 1 񮽙 take a checkpoint of the process state, 2</p><p>񮽙 simulate a misprediction, 3 񮽙 execute the speculative path, and 4</p><p>񮽙 rollback the process to the checkpoint and continue normal execution. This way, we temporarily redirect the normal application flow into the speculative path so that all invalid memory accesses on it become visible to software. This method simulates the worst-case scenario by examining each possible mispredicted path, without making assumptions about the way the underlying hardware decides whether to speculate or not.</p><p>We further extend speculation exposure to nested speculation, which occurs when a CPU begins a new speculation before resolving the previous one. To simulate it, for each speculatable instruction, we dynamically generate a tree of all possible speculative paths starting from this instruction and branching on every next speculatable instruction. The complete nested simulation, however, has proven to be too slow. To make fuzzing practical we develop a heuristic which prioritizes traversal of the speculation sub-trees with high likelihood of detecting new vulnerabilities.</p><p>To showcase our method, we implement SpecFuzz, a tool for detecting Bounds Check Bypass (BCB) vulnerabilities. SpecFuzz simulates conditional jump mispredictions by placing an additional jump with an inverted condition before every conditional jump. During the simulation it executes the inverted jump and then rolls back to return to the original control flow. To detect invalid accesses on the simulated speculative path, SpecFuzz relies on AddressSanitizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref>.</p><p>SpecFuzz may serve as a tool for both offensive and defensive security. For the former (e.g., penetration testing), it finds vulnerabilities in software, records their parameters, and generates test cases. For the latter, the fuzzing results are passed to automated hardening tools (e.g., Speculative Load Hardening <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) to elide unnecessary instrumentation of the instructions deemed safe. Note that the code not covered by fuzzing remains instrumented and protected conservatively as before, hence lower fuzzing coverage might affect performance but not security.</p><p>Our evaluation shows that SpecFuzz successfully detects vulnerable gadgets in all test programs. It detects more potential vulnerabilities than the state-of-the-art and reduces the overheads of conservative instrumentation of all conditional branches. For example, it elides the instrumentation from about a half of branches in the security-focused libHTP li- brary, and improves the performance of hardened OpenSSL RSA function, resulting in only 3% slowdown over its vanilla version, compared to the 22% slower conservative hardening.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 i = input[0]; 2 if (i &lt; size) { 3 secret = foo[i];</formula><p>Our contributions include:</p><p>• Speculation exposure, a generic simulation method for Spectre-type vulnerabilities that makes them detectable through dynamic testing.</p><p>• SpecFuzz, an implementation of the method applied to detection of Bounds Check Bypass vulnerabilities.</p><p>• A fuzzing strategy that makes nested speculative exposure feasible by prioritizing the paths that are the most likely to contain vulnerabilities.</p><p>• An analysis technique for processing and ranking the results of dynamic testing with SpecFuzz.</p><p>• Evaluation of SpecFuzz on a set of popular libraries.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Speculative Execution and Attacks</head><p>Speculative Execution. In modern processors, execution of a single instruction is carried out in several stages, such as fetching, decoding, and reading. To improve performance, nearly all modern CPUs execute them in a pipelined fashion: When one instruction passes a stage, the next instruction can enter the stage without waiting for the first one to pass all the following stages. This allows for much higher levels of instruction parallelism and for better utilization of the hardware resources. However, in certain situations-called hazards-it is not possible to begin executing the next instruction immediately. A hazard may happen in three cases: a structural hazard appears when there are no available execution units, a data hazard-when there is a data dependency between the instructions, and control hazard-when the first instruction modifies the control flow (e.g., at a conditional branch) and the CPU does not know what instruction will run next. As the hazards are stalling the CPU, they can significantly reduce its performance.</p><p>To deal with control hazards (and sometimes, with data hazards), modern CPUs try to predict the outcome of the situation and start speculatively executing the instructions assumed next. For example, when the CPU encounters an indirect jump, it predicts the jump target based on the history of recently used targets and redirects the control flow to it. While the CPU does not know if the prediction was correct, it keeps track of the speculative instructions in a temporary storage, called Reorder Buffer (ROB). The results of these speculative computations are kept in internal buffers or registers and are architecturally invisible (i.e., the software does not have access to them). Eventually, the CPU resolves the hazard and, depending on the outcome, either commits the results to the architectural state or discards them. Speculative Execution Attacks. In a speculative execution attack (in short, speculative attack), the attacker intentionally forces the CPU into making a wrong prediction and executing a wrong speculative path (i.e., executing a mispredicted path). Because taking the path violates the application semantics, it may bypass security checks within the application. Moreover, should any exceptions appear on the mispredicted path, they will be handled only during the last pipeline stage (retirement).</p><p>For a long time, this behavior was considered safe because the CPU never commits the results of a wrong speculation. However, as the authors of Spectre <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref> and Meltdown <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[36]</ref> discovered, some traces of speculative execution are visible on the microarchitectural level. For example, the data loaded on the mispredicted path will not show up in the CPU registers, but will be cached in the CPU caches. The attacker can later launch a side-channel attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">62]</ref> to retrieve the traces and, based on them, deduce the speculative results. Bounds Check Bypass. In this paper, we will showcase our dynamic testing technique on one of the speculative attacksBounds Check Bypass (BCB, also called Spectre v1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref>. In essence, BCB is a conventional out-of-bounds memory access (e.g., buffer overflow) that happens on a mispredicted path, triggered by a wrong prediction of a conditional jump.</p><p>Consider the code snippet in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Assuming that the attacker can control the input value, she can send several in-bounds inputs that would train the branch predictor to anticipate that the check at line 2 will pass. Then, the attacker sends an out-of-bounds input, the branch predictor makes a wrong prediction, and the program speculatively executes lines 3-4 even though the program's semantics forbid so. It causes a speculative buffer overread at line 3 and the read value is used as an index at line 4.</p><p>Later, the CPU finds out that the prediction was wrong and discards the speculated load, but not its cache traces. The adversary can access the traces by launching a side-channel attack and use them to deduce the secret value: The address read at line 4 depends on the secret and, correspondingly, finding out which cache line was used for this memory access allows the attacker to also find out the secret value loaded on the speculative path.</p><p>Note that without the bounds check at line 2, this vulnerability would be a conventional buffer overflow which can be detected by memory safety techniques, such as AddressSanitizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref> or Intel MPX <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>. However, since the CPU <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Speculative execution. Due to a misprediction, the program executes basic blocks BB3 and BB4, then detects the mistake, discards the results, and continues execution starting from BB2. cancels the speculation after detecting a misprediction, these techniques turn ineffective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Fuzzing</head><p>Fuzzing is a technique for discovering bugs and vulnerabilities in software by exposing it to diverse conditions and inputs. A fuzzing tool (fuzzer) automatically generates randomized inputs either from scratch, based on input grammars, or by mutating an existing input corpus. The fuzzer then feeds these inputs to the application and monitors its behavior: If an abnormal behavior (e.g., a crash) is observed, the fuzzer reports a bug. Since many bugs do not manifest themselves in externally-visible failures, fuzzing is often used in combination with memory safety techniques that can detect internal errors.</p><p>One important parameter of fuzzing is its coverage, which indicates how extensively the software was tested during fuzzing. Coverage can be defined in many ways, but the most common is to define it as a ratio of the control-flow graph edges that were executed at least once during fuzzing to the total number of edges in the application. Coverage mainly depends on the effectiveness of the input generator, that is, on how effectively it can generate inputs that trigger new control-flow paths. It is also highly dependent on the quality of the fuzzing driver, the wrapper that interfaces the application to the fuzzer. If the driver does not call some of the application's functions, they will never be covered by fuzzing, regardless of how effective the generator is.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Speculation Exposure</head><p>Speculative vulnerabilities are notoriously hard to find because hardware strives to hide the effects of speculative execution from software, making it impossible to detect such vulnerabilities with conventional testing methods. In this paper, we approach the problem by simulating the unsafe hardware optimization in software. We call this approach speculation exposure.</p><p>To understand how we construct the simulation, first consider how speculative execution is implemented in hardware ( §2.1). When a hazard appears (e.g., at a conditional</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USENIX Association 29th USENIX Security Symposium 1483</head><p>or an indirect jump), the CPU 1 񮽙 makes a prediction of its outcome, 2 񮽙 executes the speculative path while temporarily keeping the results in internal buffers, 3</p><p>񮽙 eventually eliminates the hazard and either commits the results (correct prediction) or discards them (wrong prediction), and 4</p><p>񮽙 proceeds with the correct path.</p><p>For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the CPU might make a wrong prediction that BB1 (Basic Block 1) will proceed into BB3. It will start executing BB3, BB4, and maybe even further, depending on how long it takes to resolve the hazard. When the hazard is resolved, the CPU determines that the prediction was wrong and discards all changes made on the speculative path. Afterward, it redirects the control flow to the correct path and proceeds with the execution starting from BB2.</p><p>The core idea behind speculation exposure is to simulate this behavior in software with a checkpoint-mispredictrollback scheme: At a potential hazard, we 1 񮽙 take a checkpoint of the current process state. Then, we 2 񮽙 diverge the control flow into a wrong (mispredicted) path and start executing it. When a termination condition is reached (e.g., a serializing instruction is executed), we 3 񮽙 rollback to the checkpoint and 4</p><p>񮽙 proceed with normal execution. The pattern can be applied to data hazards too: Instead of diverging the control flow, we would replace a memory/register value with a mispredicted one.</p><p>This basic mechanism simulates the worst case scenario when a CPU always mispredicts and always speculates to the greatest possible depth. Such a pessimistic approach makes the testing results universally applicable to different CPU models and any execution conditions. Moreover, it also covers all possible combinations of correct and incorrect predictions that could happen at runtime (see §3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Components of Speculation Exposure</head><p>There are four core components: a checkpointing mechanism, a simulation of mispredictions, a detection of faults on the simulated path, and a mechanism for detecting termination conditions.</p><p>Checkpointing. For storing the process state, we could use any of the existing checkpointing mechanisms, ranging from full-process checkpoint (e.g., CRIU <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) to transactional memory techniques (e.g., Intel TSX <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>). However, checkpointing is on the critical path in our case, thus heavy-weight mechanism would either increase the testing time, or reduce the number of inputs used in fuzzing under a fixed time budget. We describe the checkpointing mechanism used in our implementation in §4.1.</p><p>Simulating Misprediction. To simulate misprediction, we instrument basic blocks in a way that forces control flow to enter the paths that the CPU would otherwise take speculatively. The nature of the instrumentation depends on the exact type of the speculative execution attack being simulated (see §4 and §7 for a detailed discussion about applying this technique to different Spectre attacks).</p><p>Detection of Vulnerabilities. In Spectre-type attacks, the data is leaked when a program speculatively reads from or writes to a wrong object. Therefore, when we have a mechanism for simulating speculative execution, the detection of actual vulnerabilities boils down to the conventional memory safety problem; detecting bounds violations. This is a welldeveloped field with many existing solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">49]</ref>. In this work, we rely on AddressSanitizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref>.</p><p>Terminating Simulation. The simulation mimics the termination of the speculative execution by hardware. Speculative execution terminates: (i) upon certain serializing instructions (e.g., LFENCE, CPUID, SYSCALL, as listed in the CPU documentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>), and (ii) after the speculation exhausts certain hardware resources. Thus, the simulation terminates when one of those conditions is satisfied.</p><p>Note that terminating the simulation earlier results in faster fuzzing and could be used as an optimization, but it could miss vulnerabilities. Below we discuss the hardware resources used in speculation to determine the simulation termination conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Termination conditions</head><p>All program state changes made during the speculative execution must be temporarily stored in internal hardware buffers, so that they can be reverted if the prediction is incorrect. Accordingly, once at least one of these buffers becomes full the speculation stops.</p><p>On modern Intel CPUs, there are several buffers that can be exhausted <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>: Reorder Buffer (ROB), Branch Order Buffer (BOB), Load Buffer (LB), Store Buffer (SB), Reservation Station (RS), Load Matrix (LM), and Physical Register Reclaim <ref type="table">Table (</ref>PRRT). We seek to find the one that overflows first.</p><p>LM and PRRT are not documented by Intel. LB, SB, and RS are also not useful for practical simulations as their entries could be reclaimed dynamically (policy is undocumented) during speculative execution. Therefore, we do not simulate these buffers and assume that they do not restrict the depth of the speculation.</p><p>We are left with ROB, which keeps track of all speculative microoperations (µops), and BOB, which tracks unresolved branch predictions. We choose ROB because BOB is not portable as it is a specific optimization of Intel CPUs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>.</p><p>In Intel x86, any speculative path can contain at most as many µops as there are entries in ROB 1 . In modern CPUs, its size is under 250 µops (the largest we know is 224 entries, on Intel Skylake architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>).</p><p>The simulation terminates after reaching 250 instructions, which is a conservative estimate because one instruction is typically mapped into one or more µops. The only exception is µops fusion, when CPU merges several instructions into one. However, on Intel CPUs, it is limited to a small set of instruction combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>. To account for this effect, we count these combinations as a single instruction.</p><p>Note that a tighter bound on the number of speculated instructions (e.g., through simulation of a smaller buffer) could have improved the fuzzing time without affecting correctness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Nested Speculation Exposure</head><p>The CPU may perform nested speculation; that is, it can make a prediction while already executing a speculative path. Since we do not make any assumptions about the predictions, every speculatable instruction triggers not a single simulation, but a series of nested simulations. We refer to a tree of all possible speculative paths as a simulation tree. A simulation tree for each speculatable instruction is regenerated for each program input.</p><p>Instead of traversing the complete simulation tree (complete simulation), we could simulate only a subset of all mispredictions. Then, an order of a simulation is the maximum number of nested mispredictions it simulates. In other words, an order is the maximum depth of the simulation tree. Accordingly, an order of a vulnerability is defined as the minimum order of a simulation that triggers this vulnerability. An order of a speculative path is the number of mispredictions required to enter it.</p><p>Consider the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The left side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3a</ref>) is a control-flow graph. Suppose that the correct flow is ABD.</p><p>If we simulate branch mispredictions, then the simulation tree of branch A would be as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3b</ref>. The simulation of order 1 for that branch traverses only the path (ACBD), simulating only the first misprediction, and then following the original flow graph. The simulation of order 3 would traverse three additional paths: ACBB, ACCB and ACCC, according to misspeculation of A and B; A and C; and A,C and C respectively. The four paths constitute a complete simulation tree of the branch A. Every branch (or, more generally, every speculatable instruction) has its own simulation tree and the tree has to be traversed every time the branch is executed. Nested simulation dramatically increases the fuzzing time. However, in SpecFuzz we use a heuristic which, while traversing only a small portion of the speculation tree on each input, shows high detection rates. We discuss it in detail in §4.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">SpecFuzz</head><p>To showcase speculative exposure on a specific class of vulnerabilities, we develop SpecFuzz, a tool for simulating and detecting Bounds Check Bypass (BCB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref>. We discuss other Spectre-type attacks in §7.</p><p>As described in §2.1, BCB in its core contains a speculative out-of-bounds access caused by a conditional jump misprediction. To expose such accesses, we create a modified (instrumented) version of the application which executes not only the normal control flow but also enters all possible speculative paths.</p><p>SpecFuzz works as follows (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>): Before every conditional branch (line 4), it inserts a call to a checkpointing function (line 1) that stores the process state and initializes simulation. Then, it adds a sequence of instructions that simulate a misprediction (lines 2-3) and force the control flow into the mispredicted path. Specifically, SpecFuzz inserts a jump with an inverted condition (line 2), followed by a jump into the body of the conditional block, thus skipping the original branch (line 3). During the simulation, SpecFuzz periodically checks if a termination condition has appeared (line 8). If the check passes, SpecFuzz restores the process state from the previous checkpoint (line 9) and continues the program execution.</p><p>We implement this design as a combination of an LLVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35]</ref> compiler backend pass for the x86 architecture and a runtime library.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Basic Simulation</head><p>Simulating Branch Misprediction. SpecFuzz simulates mispredictions by forcing the application into taking a wrong branch at every conditional jump. We implement this behavior by replacing all conditional terminators in the program with the ones that have an inverted condition (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5)</ref>. Now, when the original basic block (BB) would proceed into the successor S1, the modified terminator diverges the control flow into S2. The original terminator is moved into a separate BB, and the control flow returns to normal execution by rolling back into this BB after the simulation.</p><p>As a result, every time the program reaches this BB, it first executes the simulated path, then rolls back to the BB and continues with normal execution. Saving and Restoring Process State. The main requirement to the rollback mechanism used in SpecFuzz was to have low performance impact so that the fuzzing time is kept short. To this end, we implement a light-weight in-process mechanism that snapshots the CPU state before starting a simulation and records the memory changes during the simulation.</p><p>To store the CPU state, we add a call to a checkpointing function (a part of the runtime library) before every conditional jump. The function takes a snapshot of the register values (including GPRs, flags, SIMD, floating-point registers, etc.) and stores it into memory. During the rollback, we restore the register values based on the snapshot. The function also stores the address of the original conditional jump (i.e., original terminator) that we later use as a rollback address.</p><p>This approach, however, is not efficient when applied to saving the memory state because it would require dumping the memory contents into disk at every conditional jump. To avoid the performance overhead linked with this expensive operation, we instead rely on logging the memory changes that happen during the simulation. Before every instruction that modifies memory (e.g., mov, push, call), we store the address it modifies and its previous value onto a stack-like data structure. Then, to do a rollback, we go through this data structure in the reverse order and restore the previous memory values.</p><p>Currently, SpecFuzz supports only fixed-width writes; If the pass encounters REP MOV, compilation fails with an error. Yet, we did not encounter any issues with that during our experiments because Clang in its default configuration does not use these instructions. Detecting and Handling Errors. With the simulation mechanism at hand, we now need a mechanism to detect invalid accesses on speculative paths. In SpecFuzz, we utilize AddressSanitizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref> (ASan) to detect out-of-bounds accesses and a custom signal handler to handle the errors that inevitably appear during the simulations.</p><p>We had to modify the behavior of ASan to our needs. In contrast to normal, non-speculative execution, the process does not crash if an error happens during the speculation. Instead, the CPU silences the error by discarding its effects when the misprediction is detected. To simulate this behavior in SpecFuzz, we adjusted the error response mechanism in ASan to record the violation in a log and continue the simulation. Accordingly, one test run might detect several (sometimes, hundreds of) violations.</p><p>Similarly, we have to recover from runtime faults. We register a custom signal handler that logs and rolls back after the signals that could be caused by an out-of-bounds access, such as SIGSEGV and SIGBUS. We also rollback after other faults (e.g., division by zero), but we do not record them in the log as they are irrelevant to the BCB vulnerability. We perform an immediate rollback because hardware exceptions are supposed to terminate speculative execution. Even though on some CPU models exceptions may not terminate speculation (see Meltdown-type attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36]</ref>), we ignore such cases assuming they will be fixed at the hardware level similarly to Meltdown. Terminating Simulation. As discussed in §3, we terminate the simulation either when we encounter a serializing instruction or when the maximum depth of speculation is reached.</p><p>To implement the first case, we simply insert a call to the rollback function before every serializing instruction. As serializing, we consider the instructions listed as such in the Intel documentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref> (e.g., LFENCE, CPUID, SYSCALL).</p><p>To count instructions at runtime, we keep a global instruction counter and set it to zero when a simulation begins. At the beginning of every basic block, we add its length to the counter. (We know the length at compile time because SpecFuzz is a backend pass). When the counter value reaches 250 (maximum ROB size, see §3), we invoke the rollback function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Nested Simulation</head><p>To implement nested simulation, we maintain a stack of checkpoints: Every time we encounter a conditional branch, we push the checkpoint on the stack, as well as the current value of the instruction counter and a pointer to the previous stack Order <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">JSMN Brotli HTTP libHTP YAML SSL  1  6  74  6  221  77  1254  2  5  9  4  64  92  366  3  7  12  2  33  14  253  4  1  6  3  5  16  91  5  1  2  1  2  6  - 6  0  0  0  2  2  - Total  20  103  16  327  207 1964  Iterations 933 3252 1582  540  1040 227   Table 1</ref>: Distribution (by order) of the vulnerabilities detected by 24 hours of fuzzing non-prioritized 6th-order simulation. This experiment motivates prioritized simulation: Even though all fuzzing rounds simulated all 6 orders of misprediction, most of the detected vulnerabilities required only a few mispredictions. Since execution of OpenSSL was too slow, we simulated it only to the 4th order.</p><p>frame. All later writes will be logged into the new stack frame. At rollback, we restore the topmost checkpoint and revoke the corresponding memory changes. This way, SpecFuzz traverses all possible combinations of correct and incorrect predictions in the depth-first fashion.</p><p>Coverage Trade-off. The number of paths to traverse increases exponentially with the order of the simulation. In most programs, the density of conditional branches is approximately one in ten instructions. If we assume the maximum depth of speculative execution to be 250 instructions, then it creates over 30 million speculative paths on average per conditional branch. Often the actual number of paths is smaller because the tree is not balanced, or because the tree is shallow due to serializing instructions (e.g., system calls), however the costs are still high, slowing down the fuzzing driver by orders of magnitude. It could be acceptable for very small fuzzing drivers (e.g., when fuzzing a single function), but not for larger libraries. The trade-off between the fuzzing speed and the completeness of nested simulation is a non-trivial one. In particular, it is not clear to what extent added depth of the simulation improves the detection of speculative vulnerabilities compared to the loss in input coverage.</p><p>To estimate the effectiveness of deeper simulation we compiled our test libraries (see §6) with SpecFuzz configured for a 6th-order simulation and fuzzed them for 24 hours. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> contains a breakdown of the vulnerabilities we detected by their order. Clearly, the bulk of the vulnerabilities is detected with only few levels of nesting, and the higher the order the fewer vulnerabilities we find 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The real distribution is even more contrasting. Here, the 6th-order simulation caused a high overhead and few iterations were executed <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Therefore, the fuzzer could not generate the inputs to trigger the vulnerabilities with fewer mispredictions. In fact, in §6.2, many of these vulnerabilities were discovered by lower-order simulations with more iterations.</p><p>A plausible explanation of this result is as follows. Most memory accesses are guarded by only one safety check (e.g., a bounds check) which we would need to bypass speculatively (first order vulnerabilities). More rarely, the bounds checks would be duplicated across functions or, for example, accompanied by an object type check; In this case, detecting such a vulnerability would require two mispredictions (second order). Higher order vulnerabilities usually require the speculative path to cross several function boundaries.</p><p>We can conclude that the speed of fuzzing is a higher priority than the order of simulation. Most of the vulnerabilities have low orders and we are likely to find more vulnerabilities if we have many iterations of low-order simulation compared to running few iterations of high-order simulation. In fact, in our later experiments ( §6.2), SpecFuzz detected more vulnerabilities withing an hour of low-order fuzzing compared to 24 hours with a 6th order simulation.</p><p>Prioritized Simulation. Based on this observation, we propose the following fuzzing heuristic. Our prioritized simulation tests the low-order paths more rigorously, allocating less time to higher-order paths.</p><p>A simple approach would be to always run the simulation at a baseline order and once every N iterations run a higher-order simulation. For example, all runs simulate order 1, every 4th run simulates up to order 2, every 16th up to order 3, and so on.</p><p>However, since not all runs invoke all the branches, the distribution would be uneven. Instead, we should calculate the shares per branch.</p><p>Suppose we have only two branches-X and Y-in the program under test, and we test the program with six inputs. X is executed in every run, but Y is invoked only in the runs 1, 2, 3, and 5. With the prioritized simulation, we simulate only the first-order paths of the branch X in the runs (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) and both the first and the second order paths in the run 4. As of the branch Y, we simulate the first order in runs (1, 2, 3) and up to the second order in the run 5.</p><p>We implemented this strategy in SpecFuzz and used it in our evaluation.</p><p>Simulation Coverage. Because prioritized simulation begins by traversing only one speculative path in every simulation tree and only gradually enters more and more paths, it would be important to know which share of all possible speculative paths it managed to cover within a given fuzzing round. We call this metric a simulation coverage. This metric provides an estimate of the portion of the covered speculated paths out of all possible paths for all the branches.</p><p>The trade-off different simulation heuristics might explore is a trade-off between fuzzing coverage and simulation coverage. For example, prioritized simulation gives preference to the fuzzing coverage. Unfortunately, estimating the precise number of speculative paths for each branch is a complex problem because the trees are not balanced. Solving it would require detailed program analysis, which we leave to future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Other Implementation Details</head><p>External calls and indirect calls. By the virtue of being implemented as a compiler pass, SpecFuzz cannot correctly run the simulation beyond the instrumented code. Therefore, we have to consider all calls to external (non-instrumented) functions as serialization points, even though it is not necessarily a correct behavior (see §8).</p><p>Since the complete list of instrumented functions is not known at compile time, SpecFuzz works in two stages: It first runs a dummy compilation that collects the function list, and only then does the full instrumentation. The list can be reused for further compilations if the source does not change.</p><p>This approach, however, does not work for indirect calls as we do not know the call target at compile time. Instead, we have to detect the callee type at run time. To this end, SpecFuzz inserts a NOP instruction with a predefined argument into every function entry. Before indirect calls, it adds a sequence that fetches the first instructions and compares it with the opcode of this NOP. If they match, we know that the function is instrumented and it is safe to continue the simulation.</p><p>Callbacks. There could be a situation where a noninstrumented function calls an instrumented one (e.g., when a function pointer is passed as an argument). In this case, the instrumented function might return while executing a simulation and the simulation will enter the non-instrumented code, thus corrupting the process state. To avoid it, SpecFuzz globally disables simulation before calling external functions and re-enables it afterward. Accordingly, our current implementation does not support simulation in callbacks (see a potential solution to this problem in §8). Long Basic Blocks. In the end of every basic block (BB), SpecFuzz checks if the speculation window has expired (i.e., if the instruction counter has reached 250). This could unnecessarily prolong the simulation when we encounter a long BB, which could be created, for example, by loop unrolling. To avoid this situation, SpecFuzz inserts additional checks every 50 instructions in the long BBs. Preserving the Process State. When a function returns while executing a simulation, the value of the stack pointer becomes above its checkpointed value. Therefore, if we call a function from the SpecFuzz runtime library or from ASan, it would corrupt the checkpointed stack frame. This could be avoided by logging all changes that these functions do to the memory, but it would have a high performance cost. Instead, we use a disjoint stack frame for these functions and replace the stack pointer before calling them.</p><p>The same applies to the code that SpecFuzz compiler pass inserts: We had to ensure that the code that could be executed on a speculative pass never makes any changes to memory besides modifying dedicated variables of the SpecFuzz runtime.</p><p>Code pointer checks. Besides causing out-of-bounds accesses, misprediction of conditional branches may also change the program's control flow. This happens when a corrupted code pointer is dereferenced. For example, if speculative execution overwrites a return address or the stack pointer, the program can speculatively return into a wrong function or even attempt to execute a data object. This vulnerability type is especially dangerous as it may allow to launch a ROP-like attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[51]</ref>. To detect such corruptions, we insert integrity checks before returning from functions and before executing indirect jumps.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Coverage and Fuzzing Feedback</head><p>Using existing coverage estimation techniques (e.g., SanitizerCoverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[37]</ref>, Intel PT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref>) with SpecFuzz is incorrect: the values become artificially inflated because SpecFuzz adds the speculative paths that do not belong to normal program execution.</p><p>Instead, we implement a custom coverage mechanism that counts executed conditional branches only outside the speculative paths and when the simulation is globally enabled (i.e., not in callbacks). We implement the mechanism through a hashmap that tracks the executed branches as well as the number of unique inputs that triggered every branch. In addition to coverage, this map is also used for prioritized simulation ( §4.2).</p><p>We also maintain a hashmap of vulnerabilities as an additional feedback source for evolutionary fuzzing. This way, every time we detect a new vulnerability, HonggFuzz stores the input that triggered it and adds it to the input corpus. On top of providing a better feedback to the fuzzer, this feature also allows us to preserve the test cases that trigger specific vulnerabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Aggregation of Results</head><p>As a result of fuzzing, we get a trace of detected speculative out-of-bounds accesses. Each entry in the trace has a form:</p><p>(Accessed address; Offset; Offending instruction; mispredicted branches)</p><p>Here, offending instruction is an address of the instruction that tried to access a memory outside the intended object's bounds (accessed address), and mispredicted branches are the addresses of the mispredicted branches which triggered the access. Offset is the distance to the nearest valid object, if we found one.</p><p>To make the trace usable, we aggregate the results per run and per instruction. That is, for every test run, we collect all the addresses that every unique offending instruction accessed as well as the addresses of the mispredicted branches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Vulnerability Analysis</head><p>After the aggregation, we have a list of out-of-bounds accesses with an approximate range of accessed addresses for each of them. As we will see in §6.2, the list may be rather verbose and contain up to thousands of entries. Yet, we argue that most of them are not realistically exploitable.</p><p>In many cases, the violation occurs as a result of accessing an address that remains constant regardless of the program input. Therefore, the attacker cannot control the accessed address, and cannot leak secrets located in other parts of the application memory. This could happen, for example, when the application tries to speculatively dereference a field of an uninitialized structure. In this case, the attacker would be able to leak values from only one address, which is normally not useful unless the desired secret information happens to be located at this address 3 . We call such vulnerabilities uncontrolled.</p><p>We identify the uncontrolled vulnerabilities by analyzing the aggregated traces. We estimate the presence of the attacker's control by comparing the accessed addresses in every run (i.e., every new fuzzing input). If a given offending instruction always accesses the same set of addresses, we assume that the attacker does not have control over it. Note, however, that the heuristic is valid only after a large enough number of test runs.</p><p>After the analysis, we collect a list of safe conditional branches (whitelist). The safety criteria is defined by the user of SpecFuzz. In our experiments, the criteria were: (i) the branch was executed at least 100 times; (ii) it never triggered a non-benign vulnerability. The criteria for defining whether a vulnerability is benign could be controlled too. In our experiments, they were: (i) the vulnerability was triggered at least 100 times; (ii) the vulnerability is uncontrolled. In the future, additional criteria could be added to reduce the rate of false positives.</p><p>The resulting whitelist is a plaint-text file with a list of corresponding code location, which we get based on accompanying DWARF debugging symbols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Patching</head><p>Finally, we pass the whitelist created at the analysis stage to a tool that would harden those parts of the application that are not in the list. We opted for this approach (in contrast to directly patching the detected vulnerabilities) because it ensures that we do not leave the non-tested parts of the application vulnerable.</p><p>In our experiments, we used two hardening techniques: adding serializing instructions (LFENCEs) and adding data dependencies (SLH <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>). LFENCE Pass. The simplest method of patching a BCB vulnerability is to add an LFENCE-a serializing instruction in Intel x86 architecture that prevents <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref> speculation beyond it. Adding an LFENCE after a conditional branch ensures that the speculative out-of-bounds access will not happen. We used an LLVM pass (shipped as a part of SLH) that instruments all conditional branches with this technique and modified it to accept the whitelist. Speculative Load Hardening (SLH). An alternative mechanism is to introduce a data dependency between a conditional branch and the memory accesses that follow it. This mechanism is implemented in another LLVM pass called SLH. We similarly modified the pass to accept the whitelist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Investigating Vulnerabilities</head><p>Often, it is necessary to go beyond automated analysis and investigate the vulnerabilities manually. For example, this may be required for penetration testing, for weeding out false positives, or for creating minimal patches where the performance cost of automated instrumentation is not acceptable.  To facilitate the analysis, SpecFuzz reports all the information gathered during fuzzing. For vulnerabilities, this information includes: all accessed invalid addresses and their distance to nearby valid objects (when available); all sequences of mispredicted branches that triggered the vulnerability; the order (i.e., the minimal number of mispredictions that can trigger it); the code location of the fault (based on debug symbols); whether different inputs triggered accesses to different addresses (controllability); the execution count. For branches, the SpecFuzz reports: which vulnerabilities this branch can trigger; the code location of the branch; its execution count (how many unique inputs covered this branch).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USENIX</head><p>SpecFuzz also stores the inputs that triggered the vulnerabilities, which could later be used as test cases.</p><p>Finally, when the gathered information is not sufficient, SpecFuzz can instrument a subset of branches instead of the whole application. This way, we can quickly re-fuzz the locations of interest because such targeted simulation normally runs at close-to-native speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we focus on the following questions:</p><p>• How effective is SpecFuzz at detecting BCB?</p><p>• How many vulnerabilities does it find compared to the existing static analysis tools? . We chose them because they directly process unsanitized input from the network, potentially giving an attacker the opportunity to control memory accesses within the libraries, which together with BCB enables random read access to victim's memory by the attacker.</p><p>Other tools.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Fuzzing Results</head><p>To see how effective SpecFuzz is at detecting vulnerabilities in the wild, we instrumented the libraries with SpecFuzz configured for prioritized simulation ( §4.2) and fuzzed them for varying duration of time: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 hours (63 hours in total). We used one machine and fuzzed on a single thread. Every next round used the input corpus generated by the previous ones. The initial input corpus was created by fuzzing the native versions of the libraries for an hour. Where available, we also added the test inputs shipped with the libraries.</p><p>Fuzzing iterations. Over the experiment, the average rate of fuzzing was as presented in   <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: Total number of detected vulnerabilities in each experiment.</p><p>Coverage. The final coverage of the libraries is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. The presented numbers are branch coverages; that is, which portion of all branches in the libraries was tested during the fuzzing. We show only the final number (i.e., after 63 hours of fuzzing) because we started with an already extensive input corpus and the coverage was almost not changing across the experiments. The largest difference was in OpenSSL compiled with SpecFuzz, where after one hour the coverage was 22.9% and, in the end, it reached 24%. The difference between the native and the SpecFuzz versions is caused by our handling of callbacks. As discussed in §4.3, we globally disable the simulation before calling noninstrumented functions. Hence, some parts of the application are left untested. However, it affects only performance, not security -the untested branches remain protected by exhaustive instrumentation.</p><p>Detected Vulnerabilities. The total numbers of vulnerabilities detected in each experiment is presented in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Performance Impact</head><p>We used the whitelists produced in the previous experiment to patch the libraries with LFENCEs and with a modified version of Speculative Load Hardening (see §5.4). Specifically, we used two whitelists for every library: a list based on all out-ofbounds accesses detected by SpecFuzz and a list that excludes uncontrolled vulnerabilities. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> shows the shares of the branches that were not instrumented because of whitelisting (out of the total number of branches in the application). Naturally, the shares directly correlate with the fuzzing coverage and with the number of detected vulnerabilities. If the coverage is large, the whitelisting proves to be very effective: In JSMN, SpecFuzz reduced the necessary instrumentation by ~77%.</p><p>Based on these builds, we evaluated the performance impact of the patches. For the measurements, we used benchmarks included in the libraries, where available; Otherwise, we used example applications. As such, we executed: the speed benchmark in OpenSSL (specifically, RSA, DSA, and ECDSA ciphers); unbrotli in Brotli; bench in HTTP; test_bench in libHTP; run-loader in libYAML; and a sample parser in JSMN.</p><p>The results are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. For clarity, <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> shows the same results but interpreted as a speedup of a whitelisted patch compared to full hardening. As we can see, the overhead is considerably reduced. The performance cost was, on average, reduced by 23% for SLH and by 29% for LFENCE.</p><p>An overall tendency is the higher the coverage of fuzzing,  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: Performance overheads of hardening (Lower is better). +SF(all) means that we patched all detected out-of-bounds accesses, regardless of the type; +SF(cont) means that we did not patch uncontrolled vulnerabilities that were triggered at least 100 times.</p><p>JSMN Brotli HTTP libHTP YAML SSL SLH (all) 65% 48% 44% 41% 26% 15% SLH (c,100) 69% 49% 44% 50% 27% 16% SLH (c,10) 69% 49% 44% 51% 37% 18% LFENCE (all) 73% 50% 56% 43% 27% 16% LFENCE (c,100) 77% 51% 56% 52% 28% 18% LFENCE (c,10) 77% 51% 56% 53% 39% 20% <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>: Shares of branches that avoided instrumentation based on the results of fuzzing. All means that we patched all detected out-of-bounds accesses, regardless of the type; c,100 means that we did not patch uncontrolled vulnerabilities that were triggered at least 100 times, and c,10-uncontrolled that were triggered at least 10 times. the lower the overhead becomes. It stems from our benchmarks executing some of the code paths that could not be reached by the fuzzing drivers.</p><p>Another parameter is the number and the location of detected vulnerabilities. In ECDSA, SpecFuzz detected vulnerabilities on the hot path and, hence, we were not able to remove instrumentation from the places where it caused the highest performance overhead. SpecFuzz was also not effective at improving the LFENCE instrumentation of OpenSSL because it detected speculative bounds violations in the bignum functions that are located on the hot path.</p><p>A major reasons for relatively high overheads is an issue with debug symbols that we encountered in LLVM. Sometimes, the debug symbols of the same code location would mismatch between compilations with different flags or would be completely absent for some instructions. Accordingly, some of the whitelisted locations would still be hardened. Note that this bug only impacts the performance, not the security guarantees. Nevertheless, when the issue is resolved, the overheads are likely to get lower.</p><p>One interesting example is JSMN, which experienced 5x slowdown with SLH and 11x with the LFENCE instrumentation. It is caused by an extremely high density of branches in the application (approximately one branch executed every cycle) and, thus, high reliance on branch prediction to effi- <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>: Performance improvement of SpecFuzz-based patches compared to full hardening. +SF(all) means that we patched all detected out-of-bounds accesses, regardless of the type; +SF(cont) means that we did not patch uncontrolled vulnerabilities that were triggered at least 100 times.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">SLH LFENCE +SF(all) +SF(cont) +SF(all) +SF(cont) JSMN 233% 234% 131% 132% Brotli 20% 22% 66% 67% HTTP 34% 34% 243% 242% libHTP 15% 15% 40% 52% YAML 30% 33% 93% 110% RSA 17% 19% 2% 2% DSA 13% 14% 8% 9% ECDSA 5% 5% 2% 2%</formula><p>ciently utilize instruction parallelism.

For comparison, we also tested the libraries with RedHat Scanner <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 10)</ref>. Although it detected fewer vulnerabilities than SpecFuzz, it found many vulnerabilities that SpecFuzz did not (second row). The reason behind it is almost all of them were located in the parts of code not covered during fuzzing. There were only two exceptions (row three), but both turned out to be false positives. (Because of the overwhelming amount of data, we did not investigate which share of the second row were false positives).</p><p>Respectre. Thanks to a cooperation with GRSecurity, we were able to also compare our results to a commercial static analysis tool Respectre <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>.  periment, the other 88 are located in the parts of libHTP not covered by fuzzing. SpecFuzz was able to detect more vulnerabilities due to its more generic nature: For example, it can detect vulnerabilities that span multiple functions. On the other hand, Respectre is not confined by coverage and it can detect vulnerabilities in the parts of the application that cannot be reached by fuzzing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5">Case Studies</head><p>In this section, we present a detailed overview of three potential vulnerabilities found by SpecFuzz. Note that we did not test them in practice.</p><p>Speculative Overflow in libHTP base64 decoder. One of the utility functions that libHTP provides is base64 decoder, which is used to receive user data or parameters that may be sent in text format. This functionality is implemented in function htp_base64_decode, which calls function base64_decode_single in a loop. base64_decode_single decodes a Base64 encoded symbol by looking it up in a table of precomputed values (array decoding, lines 2-3). Before fetching the decoded symbol, the function checks the value for over-and underflows. The attacker can bypass the check by training the branch predictor and, thus, trigger a speculative overread at line 7.</p><p>Two properties make this vulnerability realistically exploitable. First, the attacker has control over the accessed address because the array index (value_in) is a part of the HTTP request. Second, the fetched value is further used for defining the control flow of the program (see the comparison at line 16), which allows the attacker to infer a part of the value (specifically, its sign) by observing the cache state.</p><p>The attacker could execute the attack as follows. She begins by sending a probing message to find out which cache line the first element of the array decoding uses. Then, she sends a valid message to train the branch predictor on predicting the bounds check (line 5) as true. Finally, she resets the cache state (e.g., flushes the cache) and sends a message that contains a symbol that triggers an overread, followed by a symbol that triggers a read from the first array element. If the read value is negative, the loop will do one more iteration, execute the second read, and the attacker will see a change in the state of the corresponding cache line. Otherwise, the loop will be terminated and the state will not change.</p><p>Speculative Overflow in OpenSSL ASN1 decoding. Another vulnerability is in OpenSSL ASN1 decoder. It is used to decode, for example, certificates that clients send to the server.</p><p>The attacker sends malicious ASN1 data to the victim. The victim uses asn_ * _d2i family of functions to parse the message. One of the functions is asn1_item_embed_d2i, which, among others, decodes components of type MSTRING, verifying its tag in the process. The tag of the message is extracted through a call to asn1_check_tlen function, which delegates this calculation to ASN1_get_object. asn1_check_tlen verifies if the received tag matches the expected one (lines 22 and 23), however a misspeculation on any of these lines can nullify this check. Later, asn1_item_embed_d2i calls ASN1_tag2bit on the decoded tag value. If misspeculation happens in this function as well (line 4), the array tag2bit will be indexed with a potentially unbounded 4-byte integer. Later, this value is used to derive the control flow of the application (line 14), which may be used to leak user information.</p><p>Jump address corruption in OpenSSL ASN1. SpecFuzz detected a vulnerability that may speculatively change the control flow of the program in asn1_ex_i2c. This function includes a switch statement with a tight range of values. Such switches are often compiled as jump tables (if this optimization is not disabled explicitly).</p><p>A misprediction in the switch statement may cause an outof-bounds read from the jump table. Accordingly, a later indirect jump would dereference a corrupted code pointer and the program will jump into a wrong location. In our experiments, we saw it jumping into the functions that were nearby in the binary (e.g., into asn1_primitive_free), but, with careful manipulation of the object and data layouts, this may be extended to a speculative ROP attack.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Other Spectre Attacks</head><p>Bounds Check Bypass is not the only type of speculative vulnerabilities that could be detected by speculative exposure. Below we give an overview of instrumentation that can be used for other Spectre-type attacks.</p><p>Branch Target Injection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref> is a Spectre variant targeting speculation at indirect jumps. When an indirect jump instruction is executed, the CPU speculates the jump target using the branch predictor without waiting for the actual target address computation to finish. The attacker can exploit this behavior by training the branch predictor to execute a jump to a code snippet that would leak program data via a side channel.</p><p>SpecFuzz could be modified to simulate BTI by maintaining a software history buffer for every indirect branch in the application. Then, at an indirect branch, SpecFuzz would (i) record the current branch target into the history buffer and (ii) run a simulation for every previously recorded target. This approach works, however, only under the assumption that attacker can train the branch predictor only by providing data to the application and cannot inject arbitrary targets into the branch predictor's history buffer from another application on the same core.</p><p>Return Address Misprediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">39]</ref> attack is a variant of Branch Target Injection. The CPU maintains a small number of most recently used return addresses in a dedicated cache, pushing the return address into this cache on each call instruction and popping it from the cache on each return instruction. When this cache becomes empty, the CPU will speculate the return address using the indirect Branch Target Buffer. To simulate this vulnerability, SpecFuzz could instrument call and return instructions to, correspondingly, increment and decrement a counter, jumping to an address from history buffer on return addresses with negative or zero counter value. This simulation should be combined with the previous one as the return address prediction could fall back to indirect branch target prediction. Speculative Store Bypass. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[22]</ref> is a microarchitectural vulnerability caused by CPU ignoring the potential dependencies between load and store instructions during speculation. When a store operation is delayed, a subsequent load from the same address may speculatively reuse the old value from the cache. To simulate this attack, SpecFuzz could be extended to start a simulation before every write to memory. Then, SpecFuzz would skip the store during the simulation, but execute it after the rollback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Limitations</head><p>In this section, we discuss the conceptual problems we have discovered while developing SpecFuzz as well as potential solutions to them. Reducing the Complexity of Nested Simulation. As we discussed in §4.2, complete nested simulation is too expensive and limiting the order of simulation may lead to false negatives. One way we could resolve this problem is by statically analyzing the program before fuzzing it, such that the typical vulnerable patterns as well as typical false positives would be purged from the simulation, thus reducing its cost. False Negatives. SpecFuzz will not find a vulnerability if the fuzzer does not generate an input that would trigger it. Unfortunately, it is an inherent problem of fuzzing. Fuzzing Driver. Another inherent issue of all fuzzing techniques is their coverage. As we saw in §6, it highly depends on the fuzzing driver and a bad driver may severely limit the reach of testing. Since we use whitelist-based patching, low coverage may cause high performance overhead in patched applications. It could be improved by applying tools that generate drivers automatically, such as FUDGE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>. Mislabeling. During the evaluation, we discovered that our vulnerability analysis technique (see §2.2) sometimes gives a false result and mistakenly labels an uncontrolled vulnerability as a controlled one. It happens because AddressSanitizer reports only the accessed address and not the distance between the address and the referent object (i.e., offset). Therefore, if the object size differs among the test runs, the accessed address will also be different, even if the offset is the same.</p><p>For example, one common case of mislabeling is off-byone accesses. If an array is read in a loop, our simulation will force the loop to take a few additional iterations and read a few elements beyond the array's bounds. If the array size differs from one test run to another, the analysis would mark this vulnerability as controllable.</p><p>To avoid this issue, we could use a more complete memory safety technique (e.g., Intel MPX <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>) that maintains metadata about referent objects. Unfortunately, none of such techniques is supported by LLVM out-of-the-box. To resolve this issue, we would have to implement MPX support or migrate SpecFuzz to another compiler.</p><p>An even better solution would be to use a program analysis technique (e.g., taint analysis or symbolic execution) to verify the attacker's control. We leave it to future work.</p><p>Legacy Code and Callbacks. Because we implemented SpecFuzz as a compiler pass, it cannot run the simulation in non-instrumented parts of the application (e.g., in system libraries) as well as in the calls from these parts (callbacks).</p><p>To overcome this problem, we could have implemented SpecFuzz as a binary instrumentation tool (e.g., with PIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref>). Yet, techniques of this type are normally heavy-weight and it would considerably increase the required fuzzing time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Related Work</head><p>The most conservative solution to Spectre-type attacks is to disable prediction entirely <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> (although not all processors support it) or on a targeted basis, with serializing instructions (e.g., LFENCE on Intel CPUs or DSBSY on ARM). Speculation can also be delayed by adding a data dependency, as implemented in SLH <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and YSNB <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[44]</ref>). As we saw in §6, it causes a considerable slowdown.</p><p>Static analysis is often used to detect the Spectre-type vulnerabilities and avoid the high performance cost of full hardening. Tools like Spectre 1 Scanner <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>, MSVC Spectre 1 pass <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[41]</ref>, and Respectre <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref> analyze the binary and search for Spectre gadgets. Although mature tools like Respectre can detect many vulnerabilities (see §6), the reliance on predefined patterns may leave an unexpected variant to stay unnoticed.</p><p>Alternatively, oo7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[59]</ref> relies on static taint analysis to detect the memory accesses that are dependent on the program input. (This is the same criteria that we used to identify uncontrolled vulnerabilities.) This approach is more universal than the pattern-matching techniques, but it is affected by the inherent problems of static taint analysis. Namely, limited analysis depth may cause false positives and overtainting causes false negatives.</p><p>Tools like Spectector <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref>, Pitchfork <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref>, and SpecuSym <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref> apply symbolic execution to detect Spectre-type vulnerabilities. Although they often provide stronger security guarantees compared to fuzzing, an inherent problem of symbolic execution is combinatorial explosion, which is further exacerbated by nested speculation.</p><p>A long-term solution to the problem lays in modifications to the hardware. InvisiSpec <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[61]</ref> and SafeSpec <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref> propose separate hardware modules dedicated to speculation. CleanupSpec <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref> cleanses the cache traces when a misprediction is detected. NDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[60]</ref> restricts speculation to only "safe" paths.</p><p>Context-Sensitive Fencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[55]</ref> inserts serialization barriers at decoding stage upon detecting a potentially dangerous instruction pattern. ConTExT <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[47]</ref> proposes an extension to the memory management mechanism that isolates safety-critical data. These techniques, however, do not protect the existing processors vulnerable to Spectre-type attacks.</p><p>Classical memory safety techniques (e.g., Intel MPX <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref>, SoftBound <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[42]</ref>) do not protect from BCB, but can be retrofitted to disable speculative accesses. A variant of itindex masking-is now used in JavaScript engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[58]</ref> where, before accessing an array element, the index is masked with the array size. As it is an arithmetic operation, it does not create a control hazard and is not predicted by the CPU. However, this defense is vulnerable to the attacks where the data type is mispredicted and a wrong mask is used <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref>.</p><p>Another approach is to eliminate the possibility of leaking speculative results through a side channel (SC). There is an extensive body of research in this direction, ranging from cache isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">54]</ref>, to attack detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23]</ref>, enforcing non-interrupted execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">57]</ref>, and cache coloring <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[52]</ref>. Yet, they protect only against specific SC and speculative attacks may use various channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[48]</ref>. A relatively complete isolation can be achieved with a specialized microkernel <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref>, but it requires a complete system redesign.</p><p>In practice, browsers mitigate SCs by reducing the resolution of timers <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[58]</ref>, disabling shared memory or using site isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[45]</ref>. These techniques prevent only cross-site attacks, and are not effective at the presence of a local attacker.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A potential Bounds Check Bypass vulnerability.</figDesc></figure>
