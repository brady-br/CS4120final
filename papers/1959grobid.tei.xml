				<p>Persistent key-value (KV) stores mostly build on the Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree for high write performance , yet the LSM-tree suffers from the inherently high I/O amplification. KV separation mitigates I/O amplification by storing only keys in the LSM-tree and values in separate storage. However, the current KV separation design remains inefficient under update-intensive work-loads due to its high garbage collection (GC) overhead in value storage. We propose HashKV, which aims for high update performance atop KV separation under update-intensive workloads. HashKV uses hash-based data grouping, which deterministically maps values to storage space so as to make both updates and GC efficient. We further relax the restriction of such deterministic mappings via simple but useful design extensions. We compare HashKV with state-of-the-art KV stores via extensive testbed experiments, and show that HashKV achieves 4.6× throughput and 53.4% less write traffic compared to the current KV separation design.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Persistent key-value (KV) stores are an integral part of modern large-scale storage infrastructures for storing massive structured data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>). While realworld KV storage workloads are mainly read-intensive (e.g., the Get/Update ratio can reach 30:1 in Facebook's Memcached workloads <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), update-intensive workloads are also dominant in many storage scenarios, including online transaction processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> and enterprise servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For example, Yahoo! reports that its low-latency workloads increasingly move from reads to writes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>Modern KV stores optimize the performance of writes (including inserts and updates) using the Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Its idea is to maintain sequentiality of random writes through a log-structured (appendonly) design <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, while supporting efficient queries including individual key lookups and range scans. In a nutshell, the LSM-tree buffers written KV pairs and flushes them into a multi-level tree, in which each node is a fixed-size file containing sorted KV pairs and their metadata. The recently written KV pairs are stored at higher tree levels, and are merged with lower tree levels via compaction. The LSM-tree design not only improves write performance by avoiding small random updates (which are also harmful to the endurance of solid-state drives (SSDs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>), but also improves range scan performance by holding sorted KV pairs in each node.</p><p>However, the LSM-tree incurs high I/O amplification in both writes and reads. As the LSM-tree receives more writes of KV pairs, it will trigger frequent compaction operations, leading to tremendous extra I/Os due to rewrites across levels. Such write amplification can reach a factor of at least 50× <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39]</ref>, which is detrimental to both write performance and the endurance of SSDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Also, as the LSM-tree grows in size, reading the KV pairs at lower levels incurs many disk accesses. Such read amplification can reach a factor of over 300× <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, leading to low read performance.</p><p>In order to mitigate the compaction overhead, many research efforts focus on optimizing LSM-tree indexing (see §5). One approach is KV separation from WiscKey <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, in which keys and metadata are still stored in the LSM-tree, while values are separately stored in an append-only circular log. The main idea of KV separation is to reduce the LSM-tree size, while preserving the indexing feature of the LSM-tree for efficient inserts/updates, individual key lookups, and range scans.</p><p>In this work, we argue that KV separation itself still cannot fully achieve high performance under updateintensive workloads. The root cause is that the circular log for value storage needs frequent garbage collection (GC) to reclaim the space from the KV pairs that are deleted or superseded by new updates. However, the GC overhead is actually expensive due to two constraints of the circular log. First, the circular log maintains a strict GC order, as it always performs GC at the beginning of the log where the least recently written KV pairs are located. This can incur a large amount of unnecessary data relocation (e.g., when the least recently written KV pairs remain valid). Second, the GC operation needs to query the LSM-tree to check the validity of each KV pair. These queries have high latencies, especially when the LSM-tree becomes sizable under large workloads.</p><p>We propose HashKV, a high-performance KV store tailored for update-intensive workloads. HashKV builds on KV separation and uses a novel hash-based data grouping design for value storage. Its idea is to divide value storage into fixed-size partitions and deterministically map the value of each written KV pair to a partition by hashing its key. Hash-based data grouping supports lightweight updates due to deterministic mapping. More importantly, it significantly mitigates GC overhead, since each GC operation not only has the flexibility to select a partition to reclaim space, but also eliminates the queries to the LSM-tree for checking the validity of KV pairs.</p><p>On the other hand, the deterministic nature of hashbased data grouping restricts where KV pairs are stored. Thus, we propose three novel design extensions to relax the restriction of hash-based data grouping: (i) dynamic reserved space allocation, which dynamically allocates reserved space for extra writes if their original hash partitions are full given the size limit; (ii) hotness awareness, which separates the storage of hot and cold KV pairs to improve GC efficiency as inspired by existing SSD designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>; and (iii) selective KV separation, which keeps small-size KV pairs in entirety in the LSM-tree to simplify lookups.</p><p>We implement our HashKV prototype atop LevelDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and show via testbed experiments that HashKV achieves 4.6× throughput and 53.4% less write traffic compared to the circular log design in WiscKey under update-intensive workloads. Also, HashKV generally achieves higher throughput and significantly less write traffic compared to modern KV stores, such as LevelDB and RocksDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, in various cases.</p><p>Our work makes a case of augmenting KV separation with a new value management design. While the key and metadata management of HashKV now builds on LevelDB, it can also adopt other KV stores with new LSM tree designs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Motivation</head><p>We use LevelDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> as a representative example to explain the write and read amplification problems of LSM-tree-based KV stores. We show how KV separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> mitigates both write and read amplifications, yet it still cannot fully achieve efficient updates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">LevelDB</head><p>LevelDB organizes KV pairs based on the LSM-tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which transforms small random writes into sequential writes and hence maintains high write performance. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the data organization in LevelDB. It divides the storage space into k levels (where k &gt; 1) denoted by L 0 , L 1 , · · ·, L k−1 . It configures the capacity of each level L i to be a multiple (e.g., 10×) of that of its upper level L i−1 (where 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1).</p><p>For inserts or updates of KV pairs, LevelDB first stores the new KV pairs in a fixed-size in-memory buffer called MemTable, which uses a skip-list to keep all buffered KV pairs sorted by keys. When the MemTable is full, LevelDB makes it immutable and flushes it to disk at level L 0 as a file called SSTable. Each SSTable has a size of around 2 MiB and is also immutable. It stores indexing metadata, a Bloom filter (for quickly checking if a KV pair exists in the SSTable), and all sorted KV pairs.</p><p>If L 0 is full, LevelDB flushes and merges its KV pairs into L 1 via compaction; similarly, if L 1 is full, its KV pairs are flushed and merged into L 2 , and so on. The compaction process comprises three steps. First, it reads out KV pairs in both L i and L i+1 into memory (where i ≥ 0). Second, it sorts the valid KV pairs (i.e., newly inserted or updated) by keys and reorganizes them into SSTables. It also discards all invalid KV pairs (i.e., deleted or superseded by new updates). Finally, it writes back all SSTables with valid KV pairs to L i+1 . Note that all KV pairs in each level, except L 0 , are sorted by keys. In L 0 , LevelDB only keeps KV pairs sorted within each SSTable, but not across SSTables. This improves performance of flushing from the MemTable to disk.</p><p>To perform a key lookup, LevelDB searches from L 0 to L k−1 and returns the first associated value found. In L 0 , LevelDB searches all SSTables. In each level between L 1 and L k−1 , LevelDB first identifies a candidate SSTable and checks the Bloom filter in the candidate SSTable to determine if the KV pair exists. If so, LevelDB reads the SSTable file and searches for the KV pair; otherwise, it directly searches the lower levels.</p><p>Limitations: LevelDB achieves high random write performance via the LSM-tree-based design, but suffers from both write and read amplifications. First, the compaction process inevitably incurs extra reads and writes. In the worst case, to merge one SSTable from L i−1 to L i , it reads and sorts 10 SSTables, and writes back all SSTables. Prior studies show that LevelDB can have an overall write amplification of at least 50× <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39]</ref>, since it may trigger more than one compaction to move a KV pair down multiple levels under large workloads.</p><p>In addition, a lookup operation may search multiple levels for a KV pair and incur multiple disk accesses. The reason is that the search in each level needs to read the indexing metadata and the Bloom filter in the associated SSTable. Although the Bloom filter is used, it may introduce false positives. In this case, an SSTable is still unnecessarily read from disk even though the KV pair actually does not exist. Thus, each lookup typically incurs multiple disk accesses. Such read amplification further aggravates under large workloads, as the LSMtree builds up in levels. Measurements show that the read amplification reaches over 300× in the worst case <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">KV Separation</head><p>KV separation, proposed by WiscKey <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, decouples the management of keys and values to mitigate both write and read amplifications. The rationale is that storing values in the LSM-tree is unnecessary for indexing. Thus, WiscKey stores only keys and metadata (e.g., key/value sizes, value locations, etc.) in the LSM-tree, while storing values in a separate append-only, circular log called vLog. KV separation effectively mitigates write and read amplifications of LevelDB as it significantly reduces the size of the LSM-tree, and hence both compaction and lookup overheads.</p><p>Since vLog follows the log-structured design <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, it is critical for KV separation to achieve lightweight garbage collection (GC) in vLog, i.e., to reclaim the free space from invalid values with limited overhead. Specifically, WiscKey tracks the vLog head and the vLog tail, which correspond to the end and the beginning of vLog, respectively. Limitations: While KV separation reduces compaction and lookup overheads, we argue that it suffers from the substantial GC overhead in vLog. Also, the GC overhead becomes more severe if the reserved space is limited. The reasons are two-fold.</p><p>First, vLog can only reclaim space from its vLog tail due to its circular log design. This constraint may incur unnecessary data movements. In particular, real-world KV storage often exhibits strong locality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, in which a small portion of hot KV pairs are frequently updated, while the remaining cold KV pairs receive only few or even no updates. Maintaining a strict sequential order in vLog inevitably relocates cold KV pairs many times and increases GC overhead.</p><p>Also, each GC operation queries the LSM-tree to check the validity of each KV pair in the chunk at the vLog tail. Since the keys of the KV pairs may be scattered across the entire LSM-tree, the query overhead is high and increases the latency of the GC operation. Even though KV separation has already reduced the size of the LSM-tree, the LSM-tree is still sizable under large workloads, and this aggravates the query cost.</p><p>To validate the limitations of KV separation, we implement a KV store prototype based on vLog (see §3.8) and evaluate its write amplification. We consider two phases: Load and Update. In the Load phase, we insert 40 GiB of 1-KiB KV pairs into vLog that is initially empty; in the Update phase, we issue 40 GiB of updates to the existing KV pairs based on a Zipf distribution with a Zipfian constant of 0.99. We provision 40 GiB of space for vLog, and an additional 30% (12 GiB) of reserved space. We also disable the write cache in our prototype (see §3.2). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> shows the write amplification results of vLog in the Load and Update phases, in terms of the ratio of the total device write size to the actual write size due to inserts or updates. For comparison, we also consider two modern KV stores, LevelDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and RocksDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, based on their default parameters. In the Load phase, vLog has sufficient space to hold all KV pairs and does not trigger GC, so its write amplification is only 1.6× due to KV separation. However, in the Update phase, the updates fill up the reserved space and start to trigger GC. We see that vLog has a write amplification of 19.7×, which is close to LevelDB (19.1×) and higher than RocksDB (7.9×).</p><p>To mitigate GC overhead in vLog, one approach is to partition vLog into segments and choose the best candidate segments that minimize GC overhead based on the cost-benefit policy or its variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. However, the hot and cold KV pairs can still be mixed together in vLog, so the chosen segments for GC may still contain cold KV pairs that are unnecessarily moved.</p><p>To address the mixture of hot and cold data, a better approach is to perform hot-cold data grouping as in SSD designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, in which we separate the storage of hot and cold KV pairs into two regions and apply GC to each region individually (more GC operations are expected to be applied to the storage region for hot KV pairs). However, the direct implementation of hot-cold data grouping inevitably increases the update latency in KV separation. As a KV pair may be stored in either hot or cold regions, each update needs to first query the LSM-tree for the exact storage location of the KV pair. Thus, a key motivation of our work is to enable hotness awareness without LSM-tree lookups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">HashKV Design</head><p>HashKV is a persistent KV store that specifically targets update-intensive workloads. It improves the management of value storage atop KV separation to achieve high update performance. It supports standard KV operations: PUT (i.e., writing a KV pair), GET (i.e., retrieving the value of a key), DELETE (i.e., deleting a KV pair), and SCAN (i.e., retrieving the values of a range of keys).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Main Idea</head><p>HashKV follows KV separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> by storing only keys and metadata in the LSM-tree for indexing KV pairs, while storing values in a separate area called the value store. Atop KV separation, HashKV introduces several core design elements to achieve efficient value storage management.</p><p>• Hash-based data grouping: Recall that vLog incurs substantial GC overhead in value storage. Instead, HashKV maps values into fixed-size partitions in the value store by hashing the associated keys. This design achieves: (i) partition isolation, in which all versions of value updates associated with the same key must be written to the same partition, and (ii) deterministic grouping, in which the partition where a value should be stored is determined by hashing. We leverage this design to achieve flexible and lightweight GC.</p><p>• Dynamic reserved space allocation: Since we map values into fixed-size partitions, one challenge is that a partition may receive more updates than it can hold.</p><p>HashKV allows a partition to grow dynamically beyond its size limit by allocating fractions of reserved space in the value store.</p><p>• Hotness awareness: Due to deterministic grouping, a partition may be filled with the values from a mix of hot and cold KV pairs, in which case a GC operation unnecessarily reads and writes back the values of cold KV pairs. HashKV uses a tagging approach to relocate the values of cold KV pairs to a different storage area and separate the hot and cold KV pairs, so that we can apply GC to hot KV pairs only and avoid re-copying cold KV pairs. • Selective KV separation: HashKV differentiates KV pairs by their value sizes, such that the small-size KV pairs can be directly stored in the LSM-tree without KV separation. This saves the overhead of accessing both the LSM-tree and the value store for small-size KV pairs, while the compaction overhead of storing the small-size KV pairs in the LSM-tree is limited. Remarks: HashKV maintains a single LSM-tree for indexing (instead of hash-partitioning the LSM-tree as in the value store) to preserve the ordering of keys and the range scan performance. Since hash-based data grouping spreads KV pairs across the value store, it incurs random writes; in contrast, vLog maintains sequential writes with a log-structured storage layout. Our HashKV prototype (see §3.8) exploits both multi-threading and batch writes to limit random write overhead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Storage Management</head><p>Figure 3 depicts the architecture of HashKV. It divides the logical address space of the value store into fixedsize units called main segments. Also, it over-provisions a fixed portion of reserved space, which is again divided into fixed-size units called log segments. Note that the sizes of main segments and log segments may differ; by default, we set them as 64 MiB and 1 MiB, respectively.</p><p>For each insert or update of a KV pair, HashKV hashes its key into one of the main segments. If the main segment is not full, HashKV stores the value in a logstructured manner by appending the value to the end of the main segment; on the other hand, if the main segment is full, HashKV dynamically allocates a free log segment to store the extra values in a log-structured manner. Again, it further allocates additional free log segments if the current log segment is full. We collectively call a main segment and all its associated log segments a segment group. Also, HashKV updates the LSM-tree for the latest value location. To keep track of the storage status of the segment groups and segments, HashKV uses a global in-memory segment table to store the current end position of each segment group for subsequent inserts or updates, as well as the list of log segments associated with each segment group. Our design ensures that each insert or update can be directly mapped to the correct write position without issuing LSM-tree lookups on the write path, thereby achieving high write performance. Also, the updates of the values associated with the same key must go to the same segment group, and this simplifies GC. For fault tolerance, HashKV checkpoints the segment table to persistent storage.</p><p>To facilitate GC, HashKV also stores the key and metadata (e.g., key/value sizes) together with the value for each KV pair in the value store as in WiscKey <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). This enables a GC operation to quickly identify the key associated with a value when it scans the value store. However, our GC design inherently differs from vLog used by WiscKey (see §3.3).</p><p>To improve write performance, HashKV holds an inmemory write cache to store the recently written KV pairs, at the expense of degrading reliability. If the key of a new KV pair to be written is found in the write cache, HashKV directly updates the value of the cached key in-place without issuing the writes to the LSM-tree and the value store. It can also return the KV pairs from the write cache for reads. If the write cache is full, HashKV flushes all the cached KV pairs to the LSM-tree and the value store. Note that the write cache is an optional component and can be disabled for reliability concerns.</p><p>HashKV supports hotness awareness by keeping cold values in a separate cold data log (see §3.4). It also addresses crash consistency by tracking the updates in both write journal and GC journal (see §3.7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Garbage Collection (GC)</head><p>HashKV necessitates GC to reclaim the space occupied by invalid values in the value store. In HashKV, GC operates in units of segment groups, and is triggered when the free log segments in the reserved space are running out. At a high level, a GC operation first selects a candidate segment group and identifies all valid KV pairs (i.e., the KV pairs of the latest version) in the group. It then writes back all valid KV pairs to the main segment, or additional log segments if needed, in a log-structured manner. It also releases any unused log segments that can be later used by other segment groups. Finally, it updates the latest value locations in the LSM-tree. Here, the GC operation needs to address two issues: (i) which segment group should be selected for GC; and (ii) how the GC operation quickly identifies the valid KV pairs in the selected segment group.</p><p>Unlike vLog, which requires the GC operation to follow a strict sequential order, HashKV can flexibly choose which segment group to perform GC. It currently adopts a greedy approach and selects the segment group with the largest amount of writes. Our rationale is that the selected segment group typically holds the hot KV pairs that have many updates and hence has a large amount of writes. Thus, selecting this segment group for GC likely reclaims the most free space. To realize the greedy approach, HashKV tracks the amount of writes for each segment group in the in-memory segment table (see §3.2), and uses a heap to quickly identify which segment group receives the largest amount of writes.</p><p>To check the validity of KV pairs in the selected segment group, HashKV sequentially scans the KV pairs in the segment group without querying the LSM-tree (note that it also checks the write cache for any latest KV pairs in the segment group). Since the KV pairs are written to the segment group in a log-structured manner, the KV pairs must be sequentially placed according to their order of being updated. For a KV pair that has multiple versions of updates, the version that is nearest to the end of the segment group must be the latest one and correspond to the valid KV pair, while other versions are invalid. Thus, the running time for each GC operation only depends on the size of the segment group that needs to be scanned. In contrast, the GC operation in vLog reads a chunk of KV pairs from the vLog tail (see §2.2). It queries the LSM-tree (based on the keys stored along with the values) for the latest storage location of each KV pair in order to check if the KV pair is valid <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The overhead of querying the LSM-tree becomes substantial under large workloads.</p><p>During a GC operation on a segment group, HashKV constructs a temporary in-memory hash table (indexed by keys) to buffer the addresses of the valid KV pairs being found in the segment group. As the key and address sizes are generally small and the number of KV pairs in a segment group is limited, the hash table has limited size and can be entirely stored in memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Hotness Awareness</head><p>Hot-cold data separation improves GC performance in log-structured storage (e.g., SSDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>). In fact, the current hash-based data grouping design realizes some form of hot-cold data separation, since the updates of the hot KV pairs must be hashed to the same segment group and our current GC policy always chooses the segment group that is likely to store the hot KV pairs (see §3.3). However, it is inevitable that some cold KV pairs are hashed to the segment group selected for GC, leading to unnecessary data rewrites. Thus, a challenge is to fully realize hot-cold data separation to further improve GC performance.</p><p>HashKV relaxes the restriction of hash-based data grouping via a tagging approach (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4)</ref>. Specifically, when HashKV performs a GC operation on a segment group, it classifies each KV pair in the segment group as hot or cold. Currently, we treat the KV pairs that are updated at least once since their last inserts as hot, or cold otherwise (more accurate hot-cold data identification approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> can be used). For the hot KV pairs, HashKV still writes back their latest versions to the same segment group via hashing. However, for the cold KV pairs, it now writes their values to a separate storage area, and keeps their metadata only (i.e., without values) in the segment group. In addition, it adds a tag in the metadata of each cold KV pair to indicate its presence in the segment group. Thus, if a cold KV pair is later updated, we know directly from the tag (without querying the LSM-tree) that the cold KV pair has already been stored, so that we can treat it as hot based on our classification policy; the tagged KV pair will also become invalid. Finally, at the end of the GC operation, HashKV updates the latest value locations in the LSM-  With tagging, HashKV avoids storing the values of cold KV pairs in the segment group and rewriting them during GC. Also, tagging is only triggered during GC, and does not add extra overhead to the write path. Currently, we implement the separate storage area for cold KV pairs as an append-only log (called the cold data log) in the value store, and perform GC on the cold data log as in vLog. The cold data log can also be put in secondary storage with a larger capacity (e.g., hard disks) if the cold KV pairs are rarely accessed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Selective KV Separation</head><p>HashKV supports workloads with general value sizes. Our rationale is that KV separation reduces compaction overhead especially for large-size KV pairs, yet its benefits for small-size KV pairs are limited, and it incurs extra overhead of accessing both the LSM-tree and the value store. Thus, we propose selective KV separation, in which we still apply KV separation to KV pairs with large value sizes, while storing KV pairs with small value sizes in entirety in the LSM-tree. A key challenge of selective KV separation is to choose the KV pair size threshold of differentiating between small-size and largesize KV pairs (assuming that the key size remains fixed). We argue that the choice depends on the deployment environment. In practice, we can conduct performance tests for different value sizes to see when the throughput gain of selective KV separation becomes significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Range Scans</head><p>One critical reason of using the LSM-tree for indexing is its efficient support of range scans. Since the LSMtree stores and sorts KV pairs by keys, it can return the values of a range of keys via sequential reads. However, KV separation now stores values in separate storage space, so it incurs extra reads of values. In HashKV, the values are scattered across different segment groups, so range scans will trigger many random reads that degrade performance. HashKV currently leverages the read-ahead mechanism to speed up range scans by prefetching values into the page cache. For each scan request, HashKV iterates over the range of sorted keys in the LSM-tree, and issues a read-ahead request to each value (via posix fadvise). It then reads all values and returns the sorted KV pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7">Crash Consistency</head><p>Crashes can occur while HashKV issues writes to persistent storage. HashKV addresses crash consistency based on metadata journaling and focuses on two aspects: (i) flushing the write cache and (ii) GC operations.</p><p>Flushing the write cache involves writing the KV pairs to the value store and updating metadata in the LSM-tree. HashKV maintains a write journal to track each flushing operation. It performs the following steps when flushing the write cache: (i) flushing the cached KV pairs to the value store; (ii) appending metadata updates to the write journal; (iii) writing a commit record to the journal end; (iv) updating keys and metadata in the LSM-tree; and (v) marking the flush operation free in the journal (the freed journaling records can be recycled later). If a crash occurs after step (iii) completes, HashKV replays the updates in the write journal and ensures that the LSMtree and the value store are consistent.</p><p>Handling crash consistency in GC operations is different, as they may overwrite existing valid KV pairs. Thus, we also need to protect existing valid KV pairs against crashes during GC. HashKV maintains a GC journal to track each GC operation. It performs the following steps after identifying all valid KV pairs during a GC operation: (i) appending the valid KV pairs that are overwritten as well as metadata updates to the GC journal; (ii) writing all valid KV pairs back to the segment group; (iii) updating the metadata in the LSM-tree; and (iv) marking the GC operation free in the journal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8">Implementation Details</head><p>We prototype HashKV in C++ on Linux. We use LevelDB v1.20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for the LSM-tree. Our prototype contains around 6.7K lines of code (without LevelDB).</p><p>Storage organization: We currently deploy HashKV on a RAID array with multiple SSDs for high I/O performance. We create a software RAID volume using mdadm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and mount the RAID volume as an Ext4 file system, on which we run both LevelDB and the value store. In particular, HashKV manages the value store as a large file. It partitions the value store file into two regions, one for main segments and another for log segments, according to the pre-configured segment sizes. All segments are aligned in the value store file, such that the start offset of each main (resp. log) segment is a multiple of the main (resp. log) segment size. If hotness awareness is enabled (see §3.4), HashKV adds a separate region in the value store file for the cold data log. Also, to address crash consistency (see §3.7), HashKV uses separate files to store both write and GC journals.</p><p>Multi-threading: HashKV implements multi-threading via threadpool <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref> to boost I/O performance when flushing KV pairs in the write cache to different segments (see §3.2) and retrieving segments from segment groups in parallel during GC (see §3.3).</p><p>To mitigate random write overhead due to deterministic grouping (see §3.1), HashKV implements batch writes. When HashKV flushes KV pairs in the write cache, it first identifies and buffers a number of KV pairs that are hashed to the same segment group in a batch, and then issues a sequential write (via a thread) to flush the batch. A larger batch size reduces random write overhead, yet it also degrades parallelism. Currently, we configure a batch write threshold, such that after adding a KV pair into a batch, if the batch size reaches or exceeds the batch size threshold, the batch will be flushed; in other words, HashKV directly flushes a KV pair if its size is larger than the batch write threshold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>We compare via testbed experiments HashKV with several state-of-the-art KV stores: LevelDB (v1.20) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, RocksDB (v5.8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, HyperLevelDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, PebblesDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and our own vLog implementation for KV separation based on WiscKey <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. For fair comparison, we build a unified framework to integrate such systems and HashKV. Specifically, all written KV pairs are buffered in the write cache and flushed when the write cache is full. For LevelDB, RocksDB, HyperLevelDB, and PebblesDB, we flush all KV pairs in entirety to them; for vLog and HashKV, we flush keys and metadata to LevelDB, and values (together with keys and metadata) to the value store. We address the following questions: In our technical report <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we present results of additional experiments on the storage space usage, update performance, and range scan performance of HashKV and state-of-the-art KV stores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Setup</head><p>Testbed: We conduct our experiments on a machine running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Linux kernel 3.13.0. The machine is equipped with a quad-core Xeon E3-1240v2, 16 GiB RAM, and seven Plextor M5 Pro 128 GiB SSDs. We attach one SSD to the motherboard as the OS drive, and attach six SSDs to the LSI SAS 9201-16i host bus adapter to form a RAID volume (with a chunk size of 4 KiB) for the KV stores (see §3.8). Default setup: For LevelDB, RocksDB, HyperLevelDB, and PebblesDB, we use their default parameters. We allow them to use all available capacity in our SSD RAID volume, so that their major overheads come from read and write amplifications in the LSM-tree management.</p><p>For vLog, we configure it to read 64 MiB from the vLog tail (see §2.2) in each GC operation. For HashKV, we set the main segment size as 64 MiB and the log segment size as 1 MiB. Both vLog and HashKV are configured with 40 GiB of storage space and over-provisioned with 30% (or 12 GiB) of reserved space, while their key and metadata storage in LevelDB can use all available storage space. Here, we provision the storage space of vLog and HashKV to be close to the actual KV store sizes of LevelDB and RocksDB based on our evaluation (see Experiment 1).</p><p>We mount the SSD RAID volume under RAID-0 (no fault tolerance) by default to maximize performance. All KV stores run in asynchronous mode and are equipped with a write cache of size 64 MiB. For HashKV, we set the batch write threshold (see §3.8) to 4 KiB, and configure 32 and 8 threads for write cache flushing and segment retrieval in GC, respectively. We disable selective KV separation, hotness awareness, and crash consistency in HashKV by default, except when we evaluate them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Performance Comparison</head><p>We compare the performance of different KV stores under update-intensive workloads. Specifically, we generate workloads using YCSB <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and fix the size of each KV pair as 1 KiB, which consists of the 8-B metadata (including the key/value size fields and reserved information), 24-B key, and 992-B value. We assume that each KV store is initially empty. We first load 40 GiB of KV pairs (or 42 M inserts) into each KV store (call it Phase P0). We then repeatedly issue 40 GiB of updates over the existing 40 GiB of KV pairs three times (call them Phases P1, P2, and P3), accounting for 120 GiB or 126 M updates in total. Updates in each phase follow a heavy-tailed Zipf distribution with a Zipfian constant of 0.99. We issue the requests to each KV store as fast as possible to stress-test its performance.</p><p>Note that vLog and HashKV do not trigger GC in P0. In P1, when the reserved space becomes full after 12 GiB of updates, both systems start to trigger GC; in both P2 and P3, updates are issued to the fully filled value store and will trigger GC frequently. We include both P2 and P3 to ensure that the update performance is stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1 (Load and update performance):</head><p>We evaluate LevelDB (LDB), RocksDB (RDB), HyperLevelDB (HDB), PebblesDB (PDB), vLog, and HashKV (HKV), under update-intensive workloads. We first compare LevelDB, RocksDB, vLog, and HashKV; later, we also include HyperLevelDB and PebblesDB into our comparison. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>(a) shows the performance of each phase. For vLog and HashKV, the throughput in the load phase is higher than those in the update phases, as the latter is dominated by the GC overhead. In the load phase, the throughput of HashKV is 17.1× and 3.0× over LevelDB and RocksDB, respectively. HashKV's throughput is 7.9% slower than vLog, due to random writes introduced to distribute KV pairs via hashing. In the update phases, the throughput of HashKV is 6.3-7.9×, 1.3-1.4×, and 3.7-4.6× over LevelDB, RocksDB, and vLog, respectively. LevelDB has the lowest throughput among all KV stores due to significant compaction overhead, while vLog also suffers from high GC overhead.</p><p>Figures 5(b) and 5(c) show the total write sizes and the KV store sizes of different KV stores after all load and update requests are issued. HashKV reduces the total write sizes of LevelDB, RocksDB and vLog by 71.5%, 66.7%, and 49.6%, respectively. Also, they have very similar KV store sizes.</p><p>For HyperLevelDB and PebblesDB, both of them have high load and update throughput due to their low compaction overhead. For example, PebblesDB appends fragmented SSTables from the higher level to the lower level, without rewriting SSTables at the lower level <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Both HyperLevelDB and PebblesDB achieve at least twice throughput of HashKV, while incurring lower write sizes than HashKV. On the other hand, they incur significant storage overhead, and their final KV store sizes are 2.2× and 1.7× over HashKV, respectively. The main reason is that both HyperLevelDB and PebblesDB compact only selected ranges of keys to reduce write amplification, such that there may still remain many invalid KV pairs after compaction. They also trigger compaction operations less frequently than LevelDB. Both factors lead to high storage overhead. We provide more detailed analysis on the high storage costs of HyperLevelDB and PebblesDB in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In the following experiments, we focus on LevelDB, RocksDB, vLog, and HashKV, as they have comparable storage overhead. Experiment 2 (Impact of reserved space): We study the impact of reserved space size on the update performance of vLog and HashKV. We vary the reserved space size from 10% to 90% (of 40 GiB). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows the performance in Phase P3, including the update throughput, the total write size, and the latency breakdown. Both vLog and HashKV benefit from the increase in reserved space. Nevertheless, HashKV achieves 3.1-4.7× throughput of vLog and reduces the write size of vLog by 30.1-57.3% across different reserved space sizes. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6(c)</ref>, the queries to the LSMtree during GC incur substantial performance overhead to vLog. We observe that HashKV spends less time on updating metadata during GC ("Meta-GC") in the LSMtree with the increasing reserved space size due to less frequent GC operations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3 (Impact of parity-based RAID):</head><p>We evaluate the impact of the fault tolerance configuration of RAID on the update performance of LevelDB, RocksDB, vLog, and HashKV. We configure the RAID volume to run two parity-based RAID schemes, RAID-5 (singledevice fault tolerance) and RAID-6 (double-device fault tolerance). We include the results under RAID-0 for comparison. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows the throughput in Phase P3 and the total write size. RocksDB and HashKV are more sensitive to RAID configurations (larger drops in throughput), since their performance is write-dominated. Nevertheless, the throughput of HashKV is higher than other KV stores under parity-based RAID schemes, e.g., 4.8×, 3.2×, and 2.7× over LevelDB, RocksDB, and vLog, respectively, under RAID-6. The write sizes of KV stores under RAID-5 and RAID-6 increase by around 20% and 50%, respectively, compared to RAID-0, which match the amount of redundancy of the corresponding parity-based RAID schemes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Performance under Different Workloads</head><p>We now study the update and range scan performance of HashKV for different KV pair sizes.  When the KV pair size increases, the total write sizes of LevelDB and RocksDB increase due to the increasing compaction overhead, while those of HashKV and vLog decrease due to fewer KV pairs in the LSM-tree. Overall, HashKV reduces the total write sizes of LevelDB, RocksDB, and vLog by 43.2-78.8%, 33.8-73.5%, and 3.5-70.6%, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 5 (Range scans):</head><p>We compare the range scan performance of KV stores for different KV pair sizes. Specifically, we first load 40 GiB of fixed-size KV pairs, and then issue scan requests whose start keys follow a Zipf distribution with a Zipfian constant of 0.99. Each scan request reads 1 MiB of KV pairs, and the total scan size is 4 GiB. <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> shows the results. HashKV has similar scan performance to vLog across KV pair sizes. However, HashKV has 70.0% and 36.3% lower scan throughput than LevelDB for 256-B and 1-KiB KV pairs, respectively, mainly because HashKV needs to issue reads to both the LSM-tree and the value store and there is also high overhead of retrieving small values from the value store via random reads. Nevertheless, for KV pairs of 4 KiB or larger, HashKV outperforms LevelDB, e.g., by 94.2% for 4-KiB KV pairs. The lower scan performance for small KV pairs is also consistent with that of WiscKey (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>). Note that the read-ahead mechanism (see §3.6) is critical to enabling HashKV to achieve high range scan performance. For example, the range scan throughput of HashKV increases by 81.0% for 256-B KV pairs compared to without read-ahead. We also evaluate the range scan performance of HashKV after we issue update-intensive workloads in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">HashKV Features</head><p>We study the two optimizations of HashKV, hotness awareness and selective KV separation, and the crash consistency mechanism of HashKV. We report the throughput in Phase P3 and the total write size. We consider 20% of reserved space to show that the optimized performance of smaller reserved space can match the unoptimized performance of larger reserved space. Experiment 6 (Hotness awareness): We evaluate the impact of hotness awareness on the update performance of HashKV. We consider two Zipfian constants, 0.9 and 0.99, to capture different skewness in workloads. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the results when hotness awareness is disabled and enabled. When hotness awareness is enabled, the update throughput increases by 113.1% and 121.3%, while the write size reduces by 42.8% and 42.5%, for Zipfian constants 0.9 and 0.99, respectively. Experiment 7 (Selective KV separation): We evaluate the impact of selective KV separation on the update performance of HashKV. We consider three ratios of small-to-large KV pairs, including 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1. We set the small KV pair size as 40 B, and the large KV pair size as 1 KiB or 4 KiB. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows the results when selective KV separation is disabled or enabled.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disabled Enabled Throughput (KOPS)</head><p>58.0 54.3 Total write size (GiB)</p><p>454.6 473.7 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Experiment 8: Performance of HashKV with crash consistency disabled and enabled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 8 (Crash consistency):</head><p>We study the impact of the crash consistency mechanism on the performance of HashKV. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the results. When the crash consistency mechanism is enabled, the update throughput of HashKV in Phase P3 reduces by 6.5% and the total write size increases by 4.2%, which shows that the impact of crash consistency mechanism remains limited. Note that we verify the correctness of the crash consistency mechanism by crashing HashKV via code injection and unexpected terminations during runtime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Parameter Choices</head><p>We further study the impact of parameters, including the main segment size, the log segment size, and the write cache size on the update performance of HashKV.</p><p>We vary one parameter in each test, and use the default values for other parameters. We report the update throughput in Phase P3 and the total write size. Here, we focus on 20% and 50% of reserved space.  and 12(e) show the results versus the log segment size. We see that when the log segment size increases from 256 KiB to 4 MiB, the throughput of HashKV drops by 16.1%, while the write size increases by 10.4% under 20% of reserved space. The reason is that the utilization of log segments decreases as the log segment size increases. Thus, each GC operation reclaims less free space, and the performance drops. However, when the reserved space size increases to 50%, we do not see significant performance differences, and both the throughput and the write size remain almost unchanged across different log segment sizes. We finally consider the write cache size. Figures 12(c) and 12(f) show the results versus the write cache size. As expected, the throughput of HashKV increases and the total write size drops as the write cache size increases, since a larger write cache can absorb more updates. For example, under 20% of reserved space, the throughput of HashKV increases by 29.1% and the total write size reduces by 16.3% when the write cache size increases from 4 MiB to 64 MiB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>General KV stores: Many KV store designs are proposed for different types of storage backends, such as DRAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, commodity flash-based SSDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, open-channel SSDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and emerging nonvolatile memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref>. The above KV stores and HashKV are designed for a single server. They can serve as building blocks of a distributed KV store (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>).</p><p>LSM-tree-based KV stores: Many studies modify the LSM-tree design for improved compaction performance. bLSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> proposes a new merge scheduler to prevent compaction from blocking writes, and uses Bloom filters for efficient indexing. VT-Tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> stitches already sorted blocks of SSTables to allow lightweight compaction overhead, at the expense of incurring fragmentation. LSM-trie <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> maintains a trie structure and organizes KV pairs by hash-based buckets within each SSTable. It also organizes large Bloom filters in clustered disk blocks for efficient I/O access. LWC-store <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> decouples data and metadata management in compaction by merging and sorting only the metadata in SSTables. SkipStore <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> pushes KV pairs across non-adjacent levels to reduce the number of levels traversed during compaction. PebblesDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> relaxes the restriction of keeping disjoint key ranges in each level, and pushes partial SSTables across levels to limit compaction overhead.</p><p>KV separation: WiscKey <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> employs KV separation to remove value compaction in the LSM-tree (see §2.2). Atlas <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> also applies KV separation in cloud storage, in which keys and metadata are stored in an LSM-tree that is replicated, while values are separately stored and erasure-coded for low-redundancy fault tolerance. Cocytus <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> is an in-memory KV store that separates keys and values for replication and erasure coding, respectively. HashKV also builds on KV separation, and takes one step further to address efficient value management.</p><p>Hash-based data organization: Distributed storage systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref>) use hash-based data placement to avoid centralized metadata lookups. NVMKV <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> also uses hashing to map KV pairs in physical address space. However, it assumes sparse address space to limit the overhead of resolving hash collisions, and incurs internal fragmentation for small-sized KV pairs. In contrast, HashKV does not cause internal fragmentation as it packs KV pairs in each main/log segment in a logstructured manner. It also supports dynamic reserved space allocation when the main segments become full.</p></div>
