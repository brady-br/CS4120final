				<p>JavaScript is widely used in web-based applications, and gigabytes of JavaScript code are transmitted over the In-ternet every day. Current efforts to compress JavaScript to reduce network delays and server bandwidth requirements rely on syntactic changes to the source code and content encoding using gzip. This paper considers reducing the JavaScript source to a compressed abstract syntax tree (AST) and transmitting it in this format. An AST-based representation has a number of benefits including reducing parsing time on the client, fast checking for well-formedness, and, as we show, compression. With JSZAP, we transform the JavaScript source into three streams: AST production rules, identifiers, and literals, each of which is compressed independently. While previous work has compressed Java programs using ASTs for network transmission, no prior work has applied and evaluated these techniques for JavaScript source code, despite the fact that it is by far the most commonly transmitted program representation. We show that in JavaScript the literals and identifiers constitute the majority of the total file size and we describe techniques that compress each stream effectively. On average, compared to gzip we reduce the production, identifier, and literal streams by 30%, 12%, and 4%, respectively. Overall, we reduce total file size by 10% compared to gzip while, at the same time, benefiting the client by moving some of the necessary processing to the server.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Over the last decade, JavaScript has become the lingua franca of the web, meaning that increasingly large JavaScript applications are being delivered to users over the wire. The JavaScript code of large applications such as Gmail, Office Web Apps, and Facebook amounts to several megabytes of uncompressed and hundreds of kilobytes of compressed data.</p><p>This paper argues that the current Internet infrastructure, which transmits and treats executable JavaScript as files, is ill-suited for building the increasingly large and complex web applications of the future. Instead of using a flat, file-based format for JavaScript transmission, we advocate the use of a hierarchical, abstract syntax treebased representation.</p><p>Prior research by Franz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> has argued that switching to an AST-based format has a number of valuable benefits, including the ability to quickly check that the code is well-formed and has not been tampered with, the ability to introduce better caching mechanisms in the browser, etc. However, if not engineered properly, an AST-based representation can be quite heavy-weight, leading to a reduction in application responsiveness.</p><p>This paper presents JSZAP, a tool that generates and compresses an AST-based representation of JavaScript source code, and shows that JSZAP outperforms de facto compression techniques such as gzip <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> by 10% on average. The power of JSZAP comes from the fact that JavaScript code conforms to a well-defined grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This allows us to represent the grammar productions separately from the identifiers and the literals found in the source code so that we can apply different compression techniques to each component.</p><p>With JSZAP, we transform the JavaScript source into three streams: AST production rules, identifiers, and literals, each of which is compressed independently. While previous work has considered compressing Java programs for network transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, no prior work has considered applying these techniques to JavaScript.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Contributions</head><p>This paper makes the following contributions.</p><p>• It demonstrates the benefits of an AST-based JavaScript program representation, which include the ability to parse code in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the potential to remove blocking HTML parser operations, and the opportunity for better caching, leading to more responsive web applications.</p><p>• It introduces JSZAP, the first grammar-based compression algorithm for JavaScript. JSZAP represents productions, identifiers, and literals as independent streams and uses customized compression strategies for each of them.</p><p>• It evaluates JSZAP on nine JavaScript programs, covering various program sizes and application domains, and ranging in size between about 1,000 to 22,000 lines of code. We conclude that JSZAP is able to compress JavaScript code 10% better than gzip. JSZAP compression ratios appear to apply across a wide range of JavaScript inputs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>This section covers the fundamentals of how JavaScriptbased web applications are constructed and advocates an AST representation as a transfer format for JavaScript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Web Application Background</head><p>Over the last several years, we have witnessed the creation of a new generation of sophisticated distributed Web 2.0 applications as diverse as Gmail, Bing Maps, Redfin, MySpace, and Netflix. A key enabler for these applications is their use of client-side code-usually JavaScript executed within the web browser-to provide a smooth and highly responsive user experience while the rendered web page is dynamically updated in response to user actions and client-server interactions. As the sophistication and feature sets of these web applications grow, downloading their client-side code is increasingly becoming a bottleneck in both initial startup time and subsequent application reaction time. Given the importance of performance and instant gratification in the adoption of applications, a key challenge thus lies in maintaining and improving application responsiveness despite increased code size. Indeed, for many of today's popular Web 2.0 applications, client-side components already approach or exceed one megabyte of (uncompressed) code. Clearly, having the user wait until the entire code base has been transferred to the client before execution can commence does not result in the most responsive user experience, especially on slower connections. For example, over a typical 802.11b wireless connection, the simple act of opening an email in a Hotmail inbox can take 24 seconds on the first visit. The second visit can still take 11 secondseven after much of the static resources and code have been cached. Users on dial-up, cell phone, or other slow networks see much worse latencies, of course, and large applications become virtually unusable. Bing Maps, for instance, takes over 3 minutes to download on a second (cached) visit over a 56k modem. (According to a recent Pew research poll, 23% of people who use the Internet at home rely on dial-up connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.) In addition to increased application responsiveness, reducing the amount of code needed for applications to run has the benefit of reducing the overall download size, which is important in mobile and some international contexts, where network connectivity is often paid per byte instead of a flat rate.</p><p>From the technical standpoint, a key distinguishing characteristic of Web 2.0 applications is the fact that code executes both on the client, within the web browser, and on the server, whose capacity ranges from a standalone machine to a full-fledged data center. Simply put, today's Web 2.0 applications are effectively sophisticated distributed systems, with the client portion typically written in JavaScript running within the browser. Client-side execution leads to faster, more responsive client-side experience, which makes Web 2.0 sites shine compared to their Web 1.0 counterparts.</p><p>In traditional web applications, execution occurs entirely on the server so that every client-side update within the browser triggers a round-trip message to the server, followed by a refresh of the entire browser window. In contrast, Web 2.0 applications make requests to fetch only the data that are necessary and are able to repaint individual portions of the screen. For instance, a mapping application such as Google Maps or Bing Maps may only fetch map tiles around a particular point of interest such as a street address or a landmark. Once additional bandwidth becomes available, such an application may use speculative data prefetch; it could push additional map tiles for the surrounding regions of the map. This is beneficial because, if the user chooses to move the map around, surrounding tiles will already be available on the client side in the browser cache.</p><p>However, there is an even more basic bottleneck associated with today's sophisticated Web 2.0 applications: they contain a great deal of code. For large applications such as Bing Maps, downloading as much as one megabyte of JavaScript code on the first visit to the front page is not uncommon <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This number is for the initial application download; often even more code may be needed as the user continues to interact with the application. The opportunity to optimize this large amount of code motivates our interest in JSZAP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Benefits of an AST-based Representation</head><p>Franz's Slim Binaries project was the first to propose transmitting mobile code in the form of an abstract syntax tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In that project, Oberon source programs were converted to ASTs and compressed with a variant of LZW <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> compression. In later work, Franz also investigated the use of ASTs for compressing and transmitting Java programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>Since this original work, JavaScript has become the de facto standard for transmission of mobile code on the web. Surprisingly, however, no one has investigated applying Franz's techniques to JavaScript programs. Below we list the benefits of AST-based representation, both those proposed earlier as well as unique opportunities present only in the context of web browsers.</p><p>Well-formedness and security. By requiring that JavaScript be transferred in the form of an AST, the browser can easily and quickly enforce important code properties. For instance, it can ensure that the code will parse or that it belongs to a smaller, safer JavaScript subset such as ADSafe <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, simple code signing techniques can be used to ensure that the code is not being tampered with, which is common according to a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Caching and incremental updates. It is typical for large Internet sites to go through many small code revisions. This kind of JavaScript code churn results in cache misses, followed by code retransmission: the browser queries the server to see if there are any changes to a particular JavaScript file, and if so, requests a new version of it. Instead of redelivering entire JavaScript files, however, an AST-based approach provides a more natural way to allow fine-grained updates to individual functions, modules, etc. While unparsed source text can also be incrementally updated by specifying source ranges, AST updates can be guaranteed to preserve well-formed code with only local tree updates, while source-level updates cannot. Source-level updates may require the entire source to be parsed again once an update has been received.</p><p>Unblocking the HTML parser. The HTML parser has to parse and execute JavaScript code synchronously, because JavaScript execution can, for instance, inject additional HTML markup into the existing page. This is why many pages place JavaScript towards the end so that it can run once the rest of the page has been rendered. An AST-based representation can explicitly represent whether the code contains code execution or just code declaration, as is the case for most JavaScript libraries. Based on this information, the browser should be able to unblock the HTML parser, effectively removing a major bubble in the HTML parser pipeline.</p><p>Compression. This paper shows that an AST-based representation can be used to achieve better compression for JavaScript, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network and shortening the processing time required by the browser to parse the code.</p><p>While some of the benefits mentioned can also be obtained by extending the existing source-based transmission method, we argue the if changes are required, then an AST-based approach is both more natural and more efficient to use than adding ad hoc mechanisms onto the existing techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">JavaScript Compression: State of the Art</head><p>Currently, the most commonly used approach to JavaScript compression is to "minify" the source code by removing superfluous whitespace. JSCrunch <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and JSMin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> are some of the more commonly used tools for this task. Some of the more advanced minifiers attempt to also rename variables to use shorter identifiers for temporaries, etc. In general, such renaming is difficult to perform soundly, as the prevalence of dynamic constructs like eval makes the safety of such renaming difficult to guarantee. When considered in isolation, however, minification generally does not produce very high compression ratios.</p><p>After minification, the code is usually compressed with gzip, an industry-standard compression utility that works well on source code and can eliminate much of the redundancy present in JavaScript programs. Needless to say, gzip is not aware of the JavaScript program structure and treats it as it would any other text file. On the client machine, the browser proceeds to decompress the code, parse it, and execute it.</p><p>To better understand the benefit of minification over straight gzip compression of the original source, we did the following experiment: for each of the benchmarks listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we either obtained the original unminified source if it was available, or we created a prettyprinted version of the source from the original minified source. These files approximate what the original source contained prior to minification (not including the comments). We then compressed the pretty-printed source and the minified source (created using the tool JSCrunch) with gzip and compared the resulting file sizes. The results of this experiment are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The figure shows that the overall benefit that a programmer gets from using JSCruch prior to gzip is between 10 and 20%. Because minification is widely used in web applications, we conclude that JavaScript file size reductions on the order of 10-20% would be of interest to many web developers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Compression Overview</head><p>This section gives an overview of the JSZAP approach, with Section 4 focusing on the details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">JavaScript Compression</head><p>JavaScript code, like the source code of most other highlevel programming languages, is expressed as a sequence of characters that has to follow a specific structure to represent a valid program. This sequence can be broken down into tokens, which consist of keywords, predefined symbols, whitespace, user-provided constants, and user-provided names. Keywords include strings such as while and if. Symbols are operators such as -and ++ as well as semicolons, parentheses, etc. Whitespace typically includes all non-printable characters but most commonly refers to one or more space (blank) or tab characters. User-provided constants include hardcoded string, integer, and floating-point values. User-provided identifiers are variable names, function names, and so on.</p><p>The order in which these tokens are allowed to appear is defined by the syntax rules of the JavaScript grammar <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For instance, one such rule is that the keyword while must be followed by an opening parenthesis that is optionally preceded by whitespace. These syntax rules force legal programs to conform to a strict structure, which makes JavaScript code compressible. For example, the whitespace and the opening parenthesis after the keyword while are only there to make the code look more appealing to the programmer. They can safely be omitted in a compressed version of the source code because the uncompressed source code can easily be regenerated from the compressed form by inserting an opening parenthesis after every occurrence of the word while (outside of string constants).</p><p>Because the compressed code is not directly executable but must first be decompressed, crunching tools like JSCrunch <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and JSMin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> do not go this far. They primarily focus on minimizing whitespace, shortening local variable names, and removing comments. As in the while example above, whitespace is often optional and can be removed. Comments can always be removed. Local variables can be arbitrarily renamed without changing the meaning of the program as long as they remain unique and do not collide with a reserved word or global name that needs to be visible. Crunching tools exploit this fact and rename local variables to the shortest possible variable names such as a, b, c, etc. The resulting code is compressed because it is void of comments and unnecessary whitespace such as indentation and uses short but meaningless variable names, making it hard to read for humans.</p><p>If we are willing to forego direct execution, i.e., to introduce a decompression step, we can achieve much higher compression ratios than crunching tools are capable of achieving. For example, general-purpose compressors such as gzip are often able to further compress crunched JavaScript programs by a large amount. In the case of gzip, recurring character sequences are compressed by replacing later occurrences with a reference to an earlier occurrence. These references, which specify the position and length of the earlier occurrence, and the remaining symbols are then encoded using an adaptive Huffman scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> to minimize the number of bits required to express them. This way, keywords and longer recurring sequences such as while(a &lt; b) can be compressed down to just a few bits. As mentioned, gzip compression of JavaScript and other files is so successful that many web servers and browsers provide support for it, i.e., files are transparently compressed by the server and decompressed by the client. Nevertheless, gzip was not designed for JavaScript. Rather, it was designed as a general-purpose text compressor, making it possible to compress JavaScript even better with a special-purpose compressor like JSZAP that takes advantage of specific properties such as the structure imposed by the grammar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">AST-based Compression</head><p>One way to expose the structure in JavaScript programs is to use a parser, which breaks down the source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) whose nodes contain the tokens mentioned above. The AST specifies the order in which the grammar rules have to be applied to obtain the program at hand. In compiler terminology, these rules are called productions, the constants are called literals, and the variable and function names are called identifiers. Thus, the use of a parser in JSZAP makes it possible to extract and separate the productions, identifiers, and literals that represent a JavaScript program. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates this process, including further compression with gzip. The top portion of the figure shows the typical current process; the bottom portion illustrates the JSZAP approach of breaking down the code into multiple streams and compressing them separately. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> provides an example of how a small piece of JavaScript code is converted into these three data streams. The productions are shown in linearized format. The figure illustrates that the three categories exhibit very different properties, making it unlikely that a single compression algorithm will be able to compress all of them well. Instead, JSZAP applies different compression techniques to each category to maximize the compression ratio. Each compressor is designed to maximally exploit the characteristics of the corresponding category, as explained in the next section. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows that each category represents a significant fraction of the total amount of data, meaning that all three categories must be compressed well to obtain good overall compression. The figure shows results for our nine benchmarks, ordered in increasing size, ranging from 17 kilobytes to 668 kilobytes (see also <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The fraction of each kind of data is consistent across the programs, with a slight trend towards larger files having a larger fraction of identifiers and a smaller fraction of literals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">JSZap Design and Implementation</head><p>Because data sent over the Internet are typically compressed with a general compression algorithm like gzip, we not only want to determine how to best compress ASTs but also how to do it in a way that complements this preexisting compression stage well.</p><p>Such a two-stage compression scheme has interesting implications. For example, to optimize the overall compression ratio, it is not generally best to compress the data as much as possible in the first stage because doing so obfuscates patterns and makes it difficult for the second stage to be effective. In fact, the best approach may be to expand the amount of data in the first stage to better expose patterns and thereby making the second stage as useful as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We now describe how JSZAP exploits the different properties of the productions, identifiers, and literals to compress them well in the presence of a gzip-based second compression stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Compressing Productions</head><p>A JavaScript abstract syntax tree consists of nonterminal and terminal nodes from a JavaScript grammar. The JavaScript grammar we used for JSZAP is a top-down LALR(k) grammar implemented using Visual Parse++ <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The grammar has 236 rules, meaning that each terminal and non-terminal in the grammar can be encoded as a single byte. Because we are starting with a tree, there are two approaches to compressing data in this form: either convert the tree to a linear form (such as doing a pre-order traversal) and compress the sequence, or compress the tree directly. Our first approach was to reduce the tree to a linear form, attempt optimizations on the sequence, and then use gzip as a final compression stage. We attempted to compress the linear sequence using production renaming, differential encoding, and by removing chain productions. Production renaming. Production renaming attempts to change the assignments of productions to integers (e.g., the production Program =&gt; SourceElements might be represented by the integer 225). We might choose to rename this production to integer 1 instead, if it was a common production in our streams. The idea behind renaming is to maximize the frequency of small production IDs. However, gzip is insensitive to absolute values as it only exploits repeating patterns, which is why this transformation does not help.</p><p>Differential encoding. Differential encoding works based on the observation that only a few productions can follow a given production. Hence, we renamed the possible following n productions to 0 through n − 1 for each production. For example, if production x can only be followed by the two productions with IDs 56 and 77, we would rename production 56 to 0 and production 77 to 1. Differential encoding can potentially help gzip because it reduces the number of unique bytes and increases their frequency, but it is unclear whether this results in longer or more frequent repeating patterns that gzip can exploit.</p><p>Chain rule. Some productions always follow one specific production. For such chains of productions, it suffices to record only the first production. While this approach substantially reduces the amount of data emitted, it does not help gzip because it only makes the repeating patterns shorter. Because gzip uses an adaptive Huffman coder to encode the lengths of the patterns, not much if anything is gained by this transformation. Moreover, differential encoding and chain production removal are antagonistic. By removing the chains, the number of symbols that can follow a specific symbol often increases.</p><p>Overall, the techniques we investigated to compress linearized production streams are not effective. Nevertheless, chain production removal is quite useful when compressing the productions in tree form, as the following subsection explains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Compressing Productions in AST Format</head><p>We found that productions are more compressible in tree format. We believe the reason for this to be the following. Assume a production with two symbols on the righthand-side, e.g., an if statement with a then and an else block. Such a production always corresponds to a node and its two children in the AST, no matter what context the production occurs in. In linearized form, e.g., in a pre-order traversal of the tree, the first child appears right after the parent, but the second child appears at an arbitrary distance from the parent where the distance depends on the size of the subtree rooted in the first child (the size of the then block in our example). This irregularity makes it difficult for any linear data model such as gzip's to anticipate the second symbol and therefore to achieve good compression.</p><p>Compressing the productions in tree form eliminates this problem. The children of a node can always be encoded in the context of the parent, making it easier to predict and compress the productions. The only additional piece of information needed is the position of the child since each child of a node has the same parent, grandparent, etc. In other words, we need to use the path from the root to a node as context for compressing that node plus information about which child it is. Without the position information, all children of a node would have the same context.</p><p>One powerful context-based data compression technique is prediction by partial match (PPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. PPM works by recording, for each encountered context, what symbol follows so that the next time the same context is seen, a lookup can be performed to provide the likely next symbols together with their probability of occurrence. The maximum allowed context length determines the size of the lookup table. We experimentally found a context length of one, i.e., just using the parent and the empty context, to yield the best performance after chain-production removal. Aside from maximizing the compression ratio, using short contexts also reduces the amount of memory needed for table space and makes decompression very fast, both of which are important when running on a constrained client such a cell phone.</p><p>Since the algorithm may produce a different prediction for the empty context (a single table) and the order-1 context <ref type="table">(one table per possible parent ID)</ref>, we need to specify what to do if this happens. We use a PPM scheme that incorporates ideas from PPMA and PPMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, which have been shown to work well in practice. JSZAP's scheme always picks the longest context that has occurred at least once before, defaulting to the empty context if necessary. Because our tree nodes can have up to four children, JSZAP uses four distinct PPM tables, one for each child position. For each context, the tables record how often each symbol follows. PPM then predicts the next symbol with a probability that is proportional to its frequency and uses an arithmetic coder <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to compactly encode which symbol it actually is. This approach is so powerful that further compression with gzip is useless.</p><p>To ensure that each context can always make a prediction, the first-order contexts include an escape symbol, which is used to indicate that the current production has not been seen before and that the empty context needs to be queried. The frequency of the escape symbol is fixed at 1 (like in the PPMA method), which we found to work best. JSZAP primes the empty context with each possible production, which is to say that they are all initialized with a frequency of one. This way, no escape symbol is necessary. Unlike in conventional PPM implementations, where an order -1 context is used for this purpose, we opted to use the empty (i.e., order 0) context because it tends to encounter most productions relatively quickly in any case.</p><p>To add aging, which gives more weight to recently seen productions, JSZAP scales down all frequency counts by a factor of two whenever one of the counts reaches a predefined maximum (as is done in the PPMC method). We found a maximum of 127 to work best. JSZAP further employs update exclusion, that is, the empty context is not updated if the first-order context was able to predict the current production. Finally, and unlike most other PPM implementations, JSZAP does not need to encode an end-of-file symbol or record the length of the file because decompression automatically terminates when the complete tree has been recreated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Compressing Identifiers</head><p>The identifiers are emitted in the order in which the parser encounters them. We considered several transformations to reduce the size of this identifier stream. First, the same identifiers are often used repeatedly. Second, some identifiers occur more often than others. Third, many identifier names are irrelevant.</p><p>Symbol tables. To exploit the fact that many identifiers appear frequently, JSZAP records each unique identifier in a symbol table and replaces the stream of identifiers by indices into this table. Per se, this transformation does not shrink the amount of data, but it enables the following optimizations.</p><p>At any one time, only a few identifiers are usually in scope. Hence, it is advantageous to split the symbol table into a global scope table and several local scope tables. Only one local scope table is active at a time, and function boundary information, which can be derived from the productions, is used to determine when to switch local scope tables. The benefit of this approach is that only a small number of indices are needed to specify the identifiers. Moreover, this approach enables several important additional optimizations. For instance, we can sort the global table by frequency to make small offsets more frequent.</p><p>Symbol table sorting. Because not all identifiers appear equally often, it pays to sort the symbol table from most to least frequently used identifier. As a result, the index stream contains mostly small values, which makes it more compressible when using variable-length encodings, which JSZAP does.</p><p>Local renaming. The actual names of local variables are irrelevant because JSZAP does not need to reproduce the variable names at the receiving end. One can rename local variables arbitrarily as long as uniqueness is guaranteed and there are no clashes with keywords or global identifiers. As mentioned, one can assign very short names to local variables, such as a, b, c, etc., which is what many of the publicly available minifiers and JavaScript-generating compilers do.</p><p>Renaming allows JSZAP to use a built-in table of common variable names to eliminate the need to store the names explicitly. Consequently, most local scopes become empty and the index stream alone suffices to specify which identifier is used. (Essentially, the index is the variable name.) Note that JSZAP does not rename global identifiers such as function names because external code may call these functions by name.</p><p>Variable-length encoding. Ideally, we would like to encode a symbol table index as a single byte. Unfortunately, because we can only address 256 values with a single byte, a table that includes all the global identifiers used in a typical JavaScript program would be too large. To overcome this drawback, we allow a variablelength encoding of table index sizes (one and two bytes), and encode the most common identifiers in a single byte. We subdivide the 256-values addressable with a byte into distinct categories: local built-in symbols (mentioned above), common local symbols, common global symbols, and an escape value. The escape value is used to encode the remaining categories of symbols (uncommon local symbols, uncommon global symbols, and symbols found in the enclosing local symbol table) into two bytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Compressing Literals</head><p>The literals are also generated in the order in which the parser encounters them. The stream of literals contains three types of redundancy that we have tried to exploit. First, the same literal may occur multiple times. Second, there are different categories of literals such as strings, integers, and floating-point values. Third, some categories include known pre-and postfixes such as quotes around strings.</p><p>Symbol tables. We have attempted to take advantage of multiple occurrences of the same literal by storing all unique literals in a table and replacing the literal stream with a stream of indices into this table. Unfortunately, most literals occur only once. As a consequence, the index stream adds more overhead than the table of unique values saves, both with and without gzip compression. Thus, this approach expands instead of shrinks the amount of data.</p><p>Grouping literals by type. Exploiting the different categories of literals proved more fruitful, especially because the category can be determined from the productions, so no additional information needs to be recorded. JSZAP separates the string and numeric literals, which makes gzip more effective. For example, it is usually better to compress all strings and then all integer constants as opposed to compressing an interleaving of strings and integers.</p><p>Prefixes and postfixes. Eliminating known pre-and postfixes also aids the second compressor stage by not burdening it with having to compress unnecessary information and by transferring less data to it, which can make it faster and more effective because a larger fraction of the data fits into the search window <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. The two optimizations JSZAP performs in this regard are removing the quotes around strings and using a single-character separator to delineate the literals instead of a newline, carriage-return pair. In practice, this optimization does not help much because gzip is largely insensitive to the length of repeating patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of JSZAP using a variety of JavaScript source code taken from commercial web sites. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> provides a summary of information about the benchmarks we have chosen to test JSZAP on. Each of the nine benchmarks is a JavaScript file, with its size indicated in the table both in terms of the number of bytes and lines of code, after pretty-printing (columns 2 and 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Many of the inputs come from online sources, including Bing, Bing Maps, Microsoft Live Messenger, and Microsoft Office Live. Two of the smaller scripts (gmonkey, getDOMHash) are hand-coded JavaScript applications used in browser plug-ins. The source files vary in size from 17 kilobytes to 668 kilobytes-results show that 100 kilobytes is not an uncommon size for JavaScript source in a high-function web application like Bing or Bing Maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>We processed each input by running JSCrunch on the source code before compressing with gzip and JSZAP (although in most cases this crunching had no effect because the code had already been crunched). We did not perform automatic local variable renaming with JSCrunch during our processing, because all but one of these files (getDOMHash) was received in a form that had been previous crunched with a tool such as JSCrunch or JSMin, meaning that the local variables had largely been renamed in the original source. Pretty-printing the sources results in files that range from 900 to 22,000 lines of code.</p><p>The size of the AST representation, composed of independent production, identifier, and literal streams, is shown in columns 4 and 5. Note that the AST is in fact already smaller than the corresponding JavaScript sources, by about 25% on average. This reduction results from elimination of source syntax such as keywords, delimiters, etc. The last two columns show the size of the gzipped representation and the gzip-to-source code ratio. In most cases, gzip compresses the source by a factor of three to five. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows overall compression results of applying JSZAP to our benchmarks. We show the compression ratio of JSZAP compared to gzip. We see that in the majority of cases, the reduction in the overall size is 10% or more. It should be noted that JSZAP's AST-based representation already includes several processing steps such as parsing and semantic checking, thus reducing the amount of processing the client will have to do. Despite this fact, we are able to achieve compression ratios better  than gzip. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates that the benefits of JSZAP compression are largely independent of the input size. There is no clear correlation of compression ratios and whether the source has been produced by a tool or framework. This leads us to believe that similar compression benefits can be obtained with JSZAP for a wide range of JavaScript sources. The input with the greatest compression, facebook1, is also the input with the most effective compression of the productions relative to gzip (see next section), suggesting that the PPM compression of productions is a central part of an effective overall compression strategy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6</ref> shows the benefits of using PPM to compress the production stream. As we have discussed, the structured nature of the productions allows PPM compression to be very effective, producing a significant advantage over gzip. Just as before, we normalize the size produced using PPM compression relative to compressing the pro-  ductions with gzip. We see that JSZAP compresses the productions 20% to over 35% better than gzip, with an average improvement of 30%. Again, JSZAP's compression benefits appear to be independent of the benchmark size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Total Compression</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Productions</head><p>We note that PPM compression can easily be changed with a number of control parameters. The results reported here are based on a context length of one and a maximum symbol frequency of 127. Varying these as well as other parameters slightly resulted in minor differences in overall compression, with individual file sizes changing by a few percent. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref> presents the results of applying JSZAP to compress the identifier stream. The figure shows results normalized to using gzip to compress the identifier stream without any symbol table being used. <ref type="table">The figure includes  two different symbol table encodings: a single global  symbol table with a</ref>  as described in Section 4.2. We observe that the 2-byte encoding generally produces only small benefits and in one case hurts overall compression. Using the variable encoding results in a 12% improvement overall. Interestingly, we see that our variable encoding provides no benefit over the global symbol table in our largest application, officelive1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Identifiers</head><p>To further illustrate the effectiveness of our variablelength encoding, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> shows a breakdown of different encoding types for our benchmarks. From the figure, we see that our strategy to represent as many identifiers as possible with 1 byte succeeded, with the only major category of 2-byte identifiers being globals. We see that global 1-and 2-byte identifiers account for more than half the total identifiers in most applications. Local built-ins are also very common in the applications, especially for bingmap2, where they account for over 75% of all identifiers. bingmap2 is also one of the applications where we get the greatest benefit relative to gzip in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8</ref> explains why officelive1 does not benefit from our variable-length encoding in the previous <ref type="figure">figure.</ref> Because of the framework that was used to generate officelive1, we see that more than 80% of all identifiers are globals, and there are no local built-ins (a, b, c, etc.) We anticipate that if we tailored variable renaming appropriately by preprocessing officelive1, we could replace many of the local 1-byte identifiers with built-ins. getDOMHash, which was written by hand and did not have automatic variable renaming performed during crunching, also has many 1-byte local variables.</p><p>To conclude, we see that we obtain a relatively modest compression (12%) of the identifiers over gzip, but because gzip is designed explicitly to compress characters strings, this result is not surprising. We do find tailoring identifier compression using source-level information about local and global symbols to be beneficial.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 9</ref> shows the results of using JSZAP to process the literals before compressing them with gzip. As with the previous figures, we compare against compressing an unoptimized literal stream with gzip. Because literals are mostly single-use (except common ones such as 0, 1, etc.), using a literal table increases space usage over gzip and is not shown. Our other optimizations, including grouping literals by type and eliminating prefixes and postfixes have modest benefits, averaging around 4-5%.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>This section discusses compression in general and the specific work related to compressing JavaScript.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Mobile Code Compression</head><p>The work most closely related to JSZAP is the Slim Binaries and TransPROse projects by Franz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Slim Binaries is the first project to promote the use of transmitting mobile code using abstract syntax trees for benefits including compression, code generation, and security. The original Slim Binaries project compressed Oberon ASTs using a variation of LZW compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> extended with abstract grammars. Later, in the TransPROse project <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, Franz et al. describe a new compression technique for ASTs based on abstract grammars, arithmetic coding, and prediction by partial match. They apply their technique to Java class files and compare the results against Pugh's highly-effective jar file compressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, as well as general compressors like gzip and bzip2. With PPM compression, they achieve a compression ratio of approximately 15% over the uncompressed source.</p><p>Our work is motivated by the goals of Franz's earlier work. We also share some of the techniques with that work, including PPM compression of the production rules. Our work differs in that we adapt and optimize these ideas to compressing JavaScript. We show that for real JavaScript source code, we achieve significant benefits over the current state-of-the-art. In addition, we show that identifiers and literals constitute a significant fraction of the data that requires compression, and describe JavaScript-specific techniques to compress these streams.</p><p>In a one-page abstract, Evans describes the compression of Java and Pascal programs based on guided parsing, which also uses the language grammar to make compression more efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In another one-page abstract, Eck et al. propose Syntax-oriented Coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Guided parsing and SoC have many elements in common with Slim Binaries and TransPROse, but due to their shortness, both papers lack detail.</p><p>Other approaches to compressing mobile code have been proposed. Many of them focus on compressing a program representation that is close to the target language, specifically native machine code <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> or some form of bytecode <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Some proposals consider dynamically compressing unused portions of code to reduce the in-memory footprint of the executing program <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The main difference between this work and ours is our focus on using the augmented AST as the medium of transfer between the server and client as well as our focus on compressing the tree itself instead of a linearized format, such as an instruction stream. While bytecode-based approaches have advantages, they also require agreement about what the best translation of the source to bytecode would be. Our approach follows the current JavaScript transfer model, and maintains the content of the source without assuming a translation to a lower-level representation.</p><p>Pugh considers ways to compress Java class files. He splits data into multiple streams using redundancies in the class file information and finds a number of format specific opportunities to achieve good compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Like our work, he examines opportunities to improve second-stage gzip compression, although he does not consider using the grammar to compress the program text. Jazz <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and Clazz <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> also improve the representation of the entire Java archive but do not consider source compression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Syntax-based Compression</head><p>The problem of compressing source code has been considered since the 1980s. The idea of using the program parse as a program representation and the grammar as a means of compressing the parse was proposed by Contla <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. He applied the approach to Pascal source code and demonstrated compression on three small programs. Katajainen et al. describe a source program compressor for Pascal that encodes the parse tree and symbol tables <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. They show that their Prolog implementation of the compressor results in space gains of 50-60%. Stone describes analytic encoding, which combines parsing with compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Stone considers how the parser used (LL versus LR) affects the resulting compressibility and reports that LR parsers are more appropriate, which is what JSZAP uses.</p><p>Cameron describes source compression using the language syntax as the data model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. He suggests using arithmetic coding to compress the production rules and separating the local and global symbols to improve the compression of symbols. In applying the technique to Pascal programs, he shows a result that is approximately 15% of the size of the original source. Tarhio reports the use of PPM compression on parse trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Applying the approach to four Pascal programs, he shows that the the number of bits per production can be reduced below more general purpose techniques such as gzip and bzip2.</p><p>Rai and Shankar consider compressing program intermediate code using tree compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. They consider using tree grammars to encode the intermediate form (unlike work based on the source syntax) and show that they outperform gzip and bzip2 on lcc-generated intermediate files. They speculate that their technique could be applied to compression of XML-structured documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">XML / Semistructured Text Compression</head><p>Adiego et al. describe LZCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, a Lempel-Ziv-based algorithm to compress structured data such as XML files. Their approach takes advantage of repeated substructures by replacing them with a backward reference to an earlier occurrence. JSZAP employs the same general approach; it also transforms the original data and uses a second compression stage to maximize the overall compression ratio.</p><p>The same authors further describe the Structural Contexts Model (SCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which exploits structural information such as XML tags to combine data belonging to the same structure. The combined data are more compressible than the original data because combining brings data with similar properties together. JSZAP adopts the idea of separately compressing data with similar properties, i.e., identifiers, literals, and productions, to boost the compression ratio.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Relative benefit of using minification before gzip compression.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>This paper advocates an AST-based representation for delivering JavaScript code over the Internet and presents JSZAP, a tool that employs such an AST-based representation for compression. JSZAP compresses JavaScript code 10% better than gzip, which is the current standard. In the context of a high-traffic host serving gigabytes of JavaScript to thousands of users, the savings demonstrated by JSZAP may amount to hundreds of megabytes less to be transmitted. It is our hope that our work will inspire developers of next-generation browsers to reexamine their approach to representing, transmitting, and executing JavaScript code.</p></div>
