				<p>Counterfeit integrated circuits are responsible for billions of dollars in losses to the semiconductor industry each year, and jeopardize the reliability of critical systems that unwittingly rely on them. Counterfeit parts, which are primarily recycled, test rejects, or legitimate but regraded, have to date been found in a number of systems, including critical defense systems. In this work, we present COUNTERFOIL-an anti-counterfeiting system based on enrolling and authenticating intrinsic features of the molded packages that enclose a majority of semiconductor chips sold on the market. Our system relies on computer-readable labels, inexpensive cameras, imaging processing using OpenCV, and digital signatures, to enroll and verify chip packages. We demonstrate our approach on a dataset from over 100 chips. Our method is able to authenticate chips within 150ms, which makes it suitable for real-time use in pick-and-place machines. We show that our technique is effective and reliable for verifying provenance under a variety of settings, and evaluate the robustness of the package features by using different imaging platforms, and by wearing the chips with silicon carbide polishing grit in a rock tumbler. We show that, even if an adversary steals the exact mold used to produce an enrolled chip package, he will have limited success in being able to counterfeit the chip.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Integrated Circuits (ICs) take on critical roles in today's society, but the supply and distribution channels for ICs present a large, diverse, and vulnerable attack surface. One such threat is counterfeit parts, which are a significant and increasing threat to the reliability of electronic systems. Counterfeits are defined by the US Department of Defense as "unauthorized copies and previously used parts that are made to look new, and are sold as new" <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>. Misrepresented ICs such as speed binned parts that are remarked to a higher speed grade to increase selling price <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> can also be considered counterfeits. Prior research claims that recycled and remarked chips together make up 80% of all counterfeiting incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These types of counterfeit parts are enabled by a lack of traceability through distribution channels as parts change hands through resellers and system integrators. DARPA notes that chain-of-custody solutions are unworkable for securing distribution due to components that may change hands 15 times before final installation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Our work addresses this critical security problem by giving an approach for securing parts through distribution channels without chain-of-custody.</p><p>Estimates variously place the direct losses from electronics counterfeiting at $3B-$7.5B <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and the potential risk due to counterfeiting at $100B-$200B <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. The most commonly counterfeited electronics are said to be analog ICs, microprocessors, memories, programmable logic, and discrete transistors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Documented cases of counterfeit parts include purported microcontrollers that were found to be remarked voltage regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>, four instances of counterfeit parts in the Avionics Systems of C-27J aircraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>, and refurbished flash memory devices in Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) mission computers that led to a recall of 50 systems <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>.</p><p>Counterfeit parts such as these present clear security risks. However, it is important to note that these counterfeit parts are not targeted attacks against the specific systems in which they were found. Instead, the counterfeit parts are created and sold to earn profit. Their inclusion in critical systems is coincidence, due to the complicated global supply chain that allows common parts to be purchased on the market without clear and verifiable evidence about their provenance.</p><p>In this work we propose and evaluate COUNTERFOIL, a system that uses inexpensive cameras to check intrinsic variations in semiconductor packaging as means of verifying provenance. We name our system COUNTERFOIL both to reflect its aim of foiling counterfeits, and because the enrollment records it uses are analogs for counterfoils kept by issuers of cheques <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . The specific contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>• We show, for the first time, that individual chip packages can be recognized and authenticated using intrinsic variations in surface features, and that even chip packages produced by the same mold can be distinguished. While there are a number of research publications that authenticate objects from unique features, ours is distinct in exploiting surface variations in molded parts.</p><p>• We present a system, based on low cost cameras, image processing, and digital signatures, that can validate provenance of chips and thereby help keep counterfeits out of systems.</p><p>• We evaluate the performance of the system with regards to authentication, runtime, tolerance to variation in lighting and magnification, and resilience against wear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background and Related Work</head><p>Strategies for preventing counterfeit parts from being used in systems can be broadly classified as either trying to detect anomalies, or else authenticating individual chip instances that are trusted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Anomaly Detection as Counterfeit Testing</head><p>A common approach in counterfeit identification is to train a model based on a population of known good parts. When faced with a part of unknown provenance, a battery of tests is then applied and a classifier is used to evaluate its consistency with the trained model. The applied tests include physical inspection (visual <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, x-ray imaging, microblast analysis of the surface, spectroscopy, ion chromatography), electrical inspections <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, and checking for aging using silicon odometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, ring oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, dynamic current signatures in adders <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>, or other circuits that change in a measurable way with use. If any tests reveal an anomaly, the part can be deemed counterfeit. Anomaly detection techniques are used as part of qualification procedures by the US Department of Defense to minimize the risk of counterfeits, but "may not definitively distinguish authentic parts from counterfeit parts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. Machine learning and neural network based techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref> detect anomalies in microscopic features to classify genuine and counterfeit parts. Unlike these approaches our technique relies on extracting unique fingerprints from individual parts to authenticate provenance and thereby detect counterfeits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Authenticating Trusted Parts</head><p>An alternative to anomaly detection is to identify and authenticate individual part instances using unique or hard to clone features. If a part is trusted at one point in time, and later a part can be validated as being the same one that was earlier trusted, then a judgment can be made that the part is still trustworthy. Non-microchip versions of this style of object authentication include human fingerprints <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, anti-counterfeiting features in currency <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, variations in surface texture of blank paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and 3D printed products <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and variations in the length of compact disc pits and lands <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Similarly, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a type of physical fingerprint that can be used for authentication of parts. PUFs can be based on random delays in silicon <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, power-up fingerprints of Static Random Access Memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50]</ref>, randomly scattered dielectric particles in a protective coating <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref>, or unique Radio Frequency emissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, among many others. PUFs have also been used in conjunction with RFID-tags to detect counterfeits <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>. Several existing strategies for validating provenance of microchips are implicitly relying on the IC package as the basis for trusting the enclosed silicon die. The DARPA SHIELD project aims to embed inside IC packaging a secure dielet that can be interrogated wirelessly to validate provenance of the part <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. A company called Applied DNA Sciences offers a botanical DNA taggant that can be applied to various goods including microchip packages <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to support traceability through distribution. To date, working with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) of the US Department of Defense, the technology has marked over 700,000 microchips <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Both package-embedded dielets and package tagging have an underlying assumption that an adversary cannot easily swap a microchip out of its package, and therefore validating the package provenance suffices to validate the provenance of enclosed microchip. We will use this same assumption in our work which is based on packaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Transfer Molding for IC Packaging</head><p>Like DARPA SHIELD and DNA tags, our approach ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2)</ref> also uses the IC package as a basis for trusting parts. However, our technique exploits intrinsic features of IC packages instead of adding something to the package. We give in this subsection for reference an overview of how IC packages are created.</p><p>Transfer molding <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref> is the typical procedure used for packaging high-volume integrated circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Most DIP (dual in-line package), SMT (Surface-Mount Technology), and QFP (Quad Flat Package) packages are created this way, as well as more advanced packaging styles such as systemin-package. In the transfer molding process, each silicon die is first attached to a metal leadframe, and the pads from the die are wire-bonded to the individual leads to create electrical connections. Each leadframe-mounted die is then placed in a mold cavity, with the leads extending out the side of the cavity. A plunger liquefies pucks of epoxy molding compound using temperature and/or pressure. The liquefied compound flows through runner channels into the mold cavity to surround the  die and form the shape of the package. After the compound solidifies, the molds are released, and the leads are separated from the remainder of leadframe, which is discarded. The metal leads protruding from the formed package are now the pins of the packaged chip that will connect it to a printed circuit board. Further details on the many packaging styles for integrated circuits can be found in a popular textbook on the topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.</p><p>Several sources of variability in transfer molding can impart unique features to a package surface. The mold has a surface roughness that gets imprinted onto the package. The surface texture of the mold changes over time as residue material accumulates on the mold, and molds require cleaning to mitigate this build up <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Additionally, the molding compound itself, and its curing, contribute a certain amount of unpredictability. The molding compound is an epoxy that contains a number of fillers including crushed quartz or alumina that comprise 75% or more of the compound, and provide thermal conductivity. The size of the filler particles can range from 20-100µm, and the orientation and distribution of filler particles in the package is unpredictable. The package during post-mold curing also experiences shrinkage, cracks, porosity, and voids <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Due to aforementioned variation sources, even chips packaged in the same mold could have differences in their package surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Description of Approach</head><p>COUNTERFOIL uses package surface features to authenticate provenance of individual chips as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>. The two participants in the scheme that interact with the chip are denoted as the enroller and a verifier. The enroller acts on behalf of a chip manufacturer that wishes to sell parts with an assurance of provenance. The verifier is a customer that Algorithm 1: ENROLLCHIP Input: Image img of chip surface with marker attached. Private key k pr for signing messages.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 eid ← readMarker(img) 2 f eid ← extractKeypoints(img, r, θ, w enroll ) 3 s( f eid ) ← Sign(k pr , f eid ) 4 database[eid] ← f eid s( f eid ) 5 return</formula><p>Algorithm 2: VERIFYCHIP Input: Image img of chip surface with marker attached.

Both the manufacturer as enroller, and customer as verifier, have incentives for participating in the presented scheme. The chip manufacturer can make their products more attractive by offering an assurance that authentic parts bearing their branding can be verified as produced by them. Importantly, they can accomplish this without needing to trust every point in their distribution channels. The chip customer is incentivized to participate because systems that are free from counterfeit chips can avoid costly failures or recalls that are caused by counterfeits <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>.</p><p>The enroller extracts fingerprints from package surface features using image processing and publishes information about enrolled chips to a public database. Integrity of database entries is assured by digital signatures. The enroller holds a private key k pr for signing messages, and gives the corresponding public key k pub to any parties that wish to act as verifiers. Our implementation uses the simplifying assumption of pre-existing public keys for enroller and verifier, but in practice this could, for example, rely on a trusted certificate authority. The enroller uses the private key to sign database entries when writing them, and the verifier uses the enroller's corresponding public key to check the signatures when reading from the database. More details about the enrollment (Alg. 1) and verification (Alg. 2) procedures are given below. Details of the image processing performed in enrollment and verification are deferred to Sec. 4. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Enrollment</head><p>The enrollment procedure should occur as part of the packaging of an IC. The IC should be trusted at the time of packaging, as the goal is to later tie provenance back to this point. Each die is sealed inside of a molded plastic package as usual by means of transfer molding (see Sec. 2.3 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). After the package hardens and cures, a label with a computer-readable identification marker is affixed to the surface of the package. The marker represents an insecure numerical identifier of the chip instance, similar to a serial number, which we denote as its eid (enrollment identifier). The enroller then takes an image that captures both the marker, and the package surface in the vicinity of the marker, from which the fingerprint will be extracted. A digitized enrollment fingerprint f eid is extracted from the image, using a procedure that will be explained in Sec. 4.2. The date of manufacture and other metadata can be appended to the fingerprint at this point. The enroller creates signature s( f eid ) by digitally signing fingerprint f eid using private key k pr (Alg. 1, line 3). An entry is added to the public database to associate the identifier eid with f eid s( f eid ) (Alg. 1, line 4). Once the chip is enrolled to the database, it is released into distribution channels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Verification</head><p>The verification procedure checks authenticity of chips at the end of distribution. The verifier takes an image of the chip that includes both the marker and the package surface in the vicinity of the marker. The insecure identifier (eid) of the marker is extracted from the image. The enrolled data f eid s( f eid ) for this identifier is accessed from the database (Alg. 2, line 2). The validity of signature s( f eid ) is checked using the public key k pub of the enroller (Alg. 2, line 3). The enrolled fingerprint f eid is compared against a new fingerprint f v that is extracted from the relevant area of the chip package surface. If the similarity score exceeds a chosen threshold, then the package surface is determined to match the record (Alg. 2, line 5). The chip is verified as authentic only if the digital signature is valid, and the fingerprints match. The validity of the signature ensures that the enrolled fingerprint in the public database was created by the enroller and has not been modified. The fingerprint match ensures that the enrolled data is not being used to authenticate a chip other than the one that was enrolled, a scenario that would arise if a label was copied or transferred from one chip to another. The verification procedure is currently performed on a workbench in our lab, but could later, for example, be integrated into a pick-and-place machine at the end of distribution that picks chips from reels and places them appropriately onto printed circuit boards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Attacker Capabilities and Security Considerations</head><p>The attacker considered in this work is a profit-motivated counterfeiter that forges chips for purpose of selling them on the market. This type of profit-seeking attacker is responsible for prior counterfeit parts found in sensitive systems, but note that it does not include nation-state attackers that may spend large amounts of money to create malicious forgeries to bring down targeted high-value systems. For a profit-seeking attacker, if the effort of forging chips exceeds the selling price of the chip on the market, there is no incentive to forge the chips. At the same time, the cost for anti-counterfeiting technology in commodity parts cannot exceed what the producer or consumer of the parts is willing to spend for the guarantee of provenance. The security of our approach relies on assumptions similar to those in earlier work on certificates of authenticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Our assumptions relate to the enrollment and verification protocol, the uniqueness of package fingerprints, and the difficulty of creating forged chip packages that match legitimately enrolled fingerprints. Among these three, the first is intended to be uncontroversial, and the latter two are supported by experimental data in the paper.</p><p>1. Protocol Integrity: We make the standard assumption that an adversary is not able to obtain the enroller's private key or forge digital signatures without having the private key. We assume that the enroller is trusted to only package legitimate integrated circuits, and to enroll only these packages with the private key k pr .</p><p>2. Unique Fingerprints: We rely on the fact that package fingerprints created under ordinary conditions are unique and are identifiable via image processing. Specifically, an enrolled fingerprint from one package will not be deemed a match for any package other than the enrolled one. Fingerprint uniqueness binds the enrolled data to a specific chip instance. If labels are later affixed to chips other than the enrolled, the enrollment data associated to the label will not match the chip characteristic. This prevents an adversary from successfully copying or transferring labels across chips.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Difficulty of Package Forgery:</head><p>We assume, and then support experimentally, that package fingerprints are random and difficult to control. This prevents an adversary from creating a new package surface that matches a legitimate enrolled fingerprint. We support this assumption by showing that even chips from the same mold have different fingerprints. This implies that even possession of an identical mold will not enable an adversary to successfully forge packages and therefore forgery requires a more advanced manufacturing process than what industry uses for packaging chips. Regardless of the process used to create forgeries, an adversary will have to create recognizable features with sizes on the order of 10µm (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>). Besides attempting to clone the package surface an attacker could print a label with features from a legitimate chip. However, the printing task is seemingly out of reach of many technologies such as high-end 2400 DPI printers, which have a dot size of 10.6µm and can only print reliable features at a much larger scale than its dot size. Aside from forgery, an adversary might transfer the package from a legitimate part to a counterfeit IC, but there would be no profit motive to this, as it would destroy a legitimate chip to create a single forged chip.</p><p>Practical security concerns of our prototype system warrant further discussion. One concern is that an adversary could make a chip unverifiable by removing, moving, or damaging its label. This threatens reliability more than security because it does not falsely authenticate counterfeits, and because counterfeiters would not directly profit from destroying the labels.  For reliability, the paper labels used in our prototype system would likely be replaced by more robust markings when deploying COUNTERFOIL at production scale outside of the lab. A second practical concern pertains to the use of a public database for enrollment records. The records in the database reveal information about quantity and schedule of produced parts, which may be sensitive to the manufacturer. Similarly, database queries that happen in the clear could reveal business information about the consumer. Where this is a concern, the enrolled data could be made private and provided only to trusted verifiers, or cryptographic protocols for oblivious transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> or anonymous credentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> could be used to ensure privacy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Image Processing and Analysis</head><p>Our system relies on image processing as part of enrollment and verification. Enrollment generates a digitized representation of recognizable features within a selected area of the package surface. Verification later scores the record of enrolled features against a new image of the package surface. In this section we describe the computer vision algorithms used. Our algorithms are written in C++ using OpenCV <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for the image processing. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Aruco Marker Labels and ROI Detection</head><p>Our system uses computer-readable labels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2)</ref> to represent the purported identity of a package. The labels are placed, to the extent possible with manual placement, in the same position on each package. For convenience the labels are also used as fiducial marks to define the Region Of Interest (ROI) in the enrollment and verification images, although other easily-recognized features could be used instead of the labels for this purpose. Aruco, the specific marker system that we use, is a square-based fiducial marker system with binary codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Aruco marker dictionaries are configurable, allowing for an arbitrary marker capacity (in bits) and number of markers. We use Aruco markers to label the chips with the search tag of the public database. The four corners of the marker allow for detection of image orientation (pose estimation) which we leverage to determine the ROI for further processing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows a detected marker with its topleft corner used to determine the center of ROI at a distance &lt; r, θ &gt; relative to the marker. Depending on whether the image is being processed for enrollment or verification, the ROI selected from the image would be either ROI enroll (blue square) and ROI veri f y (red square). Both squares are centered at the same point, and have a size that is defined relative to the marker size for magnification invariance. The width of the larger square is w enroll = 2mm, and the width of the smaller square is w veri f y = w enroll / √ 2. The difference in ROI sizes ensures that the ROI from enrollment will always contain the ROI from verification regardless of rotation. Consider the yellow circle in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> which is centered at point &lt; r, θ &gt;. Regardless of the image orientation, the red square will always be contained within the circle, and the blue square will always contain the circle. Therefore, the blue square (ROI enroll ) will always contain the red square (ROI veri f y ). Further, ROI enroll is chosen larger than ROI veri f y to save runtime, as the verification involves more processing steps than enrollment. In our experiments we use r = 5mm and θ = π/8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Feature Enrollment</head><p>The enrollment process extracts distinctive features from an image which are suitable for matching and object recognition, and stores them as compact feature descriptors. A number of well-known image processing techniques exist for feature detection and description, such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>, Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These techniques are commonly used in applications such as image stitching, where image alignment requires finding corresponding points of objects in two different images that contain the objects. Our work is agnostic to the choice of algorithm, but based on empirical evaluation (as will be discussed in Sec. 5.2.1) we choose ORB.</p><p>We first pre-process the image (ROI) using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to improve the contrast and tolerance to variation in lighting intensity. We then use OpenCV's implementation of ORB to extract image features. The keypoints are detected by Oriented FAST algorithm and described by 256-dimensional rotated BRIEF descriptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>. Similarity between two keypoints can be evaluated using feature distance, which is the Euclidean distance between two keypoints in the 256-dimensional feature space. The keypoints also have associated positions within an image, and we will use pixel distance to denote the Euclidean distance in two dimensions between pixels in an image. For the sake of predictable runtime, we restrict the number of keypoints to 1,000/mm 2 of package surface. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref> shows the keypoints extracted from the region of interest.</p><p>The enrolled features are stored in a public database along with a digital signature <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The NIST Digital Signature Standard (DSS) establishes three algorithms for signatures, RSA, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We choose DSA in our implementation, but this can replaced by either of the other algorithms with minimal performance impact. For hashing function, SHA-3 is chosen because it is the latest Cryptographic Hash Standard issued by NIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. More specifically, the enrollment data is hashed using SHA3-256 and subsequently signed with the enroller's private key using an implementation of DSA with 3072-bit private key from the open-source Crypto++ library <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Details about performance are presented in Sec. 5.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Feature Verification</head><p>Verification compares the enrolled keypoints against the ROI of a new image in to order compute a similarity score. The integrity of enrolled keypoints is first verified by checking the digital signature. When a new image is captured for verification, its ROI is identified relative to the marker, and keypoints are extracted from the ROI. This mirrors the corresponding steps performed in feature enrollment, so we don't repeat their description here. The processing performed with the verification keypoints is as follows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Feature Matching and RANSAC based Homography Computation</head><p>Two images of the same planar surface taken from different perspectives are related by a homography, which is a geometric model that maps feature positions in one image to the corresponding positions in the second image. Estimating the homography requires finding enrollment and verification keypoints that are similar and therefore likely to be representations of the same feature on the package surface. We find such points by performing nearest neighbor matching using OpenCV's FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> matcher, and then evaluating quality of matches using a standard approach based on ratio of feature distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> as described here. For every keypoint k i in ROI enroll , we find its two closest (in feature distance) keypoints (k 1 and k 2 ) from ROI veri f y and compute from their Euclidean distance in feature space a ratio score r i =</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">k i −k 1 2 k i −k 2 2</formula><p>. A low ratio indicates that keypoint k i is significantly more similar to its best match k 1 than to its second best match k 2 , which implies that k i and k 1 are likely to be corresponding points in the two images <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The 50 keypoint pairs with the lowest ratios (i.e., the best matches) are used as the basis for estimating a homography with the RANSAC algorithm. Increasing the number of matches will reduce the chance of RANSAC reaching consensus on an incorrect homography, but increases the expected number of random samples required to find consensus. RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is an algorithm to estimate a model from noisy data that contains both inliers and outliers. In our case, the computed model is the homography, and the data are the 50 selected keypoint pairs. RANSAC first samples four keypoint pairs from the set and calculates from them a homography matrix as in Eq. 1, where the 3x3 matrix is the homography, and P e and P v are the respective coordinates in enrollment and verification images of the keypoints. The quality of the homography model is then evaluated according to how many of the 50 keypoint pairs fit the model. Each pair that fits the homography model is considered an inlier. The process iterates to calculate and evaluate homographies from different sample points, and the homography with the highest number of inliers is returned as the best fit for the data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Projection and Scoring</head><p>Using the enrollment and verification keypoints, and the homography between them, we compute a score that indicates how many of the enrolled keypoints have good matches in the set of verification keypoints. An enrolled keypoint is considered to have a good match if there exists a verification keypoint that satisfies two conditions: (1) it is highly similar to the enrolled keypoint, and (2) it is at the position where the enrolled keypoint should be found in the verification image. The first condition is formalized as a requirement of being the nearest neighbor in feature space to the enrolled keypoint, and being at least 25% nearer than its second-closest neighbor (i.e. ratio score r i ≤ 0.75). The second condition is formalized as a requirement of being within 2 pixels of the location where the homography predicts the enrolled keypoint to be in the verification image. This ensures that matched features are not only similar, but also geometrically consistent with relative positions of the enrolled keypoints. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref> shows the pixel distance between the homography projection of an enrolled keypoint and the location of the verification keypoint that is its nearest neighbor in feature space. The data is collected from 100 different verification trials. The peak at left indicates that the nearest neighbor is often found within two pixels of the location predicted by the homography. These points are the inliers.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">System Evaluation</head><p>We evaluate the COUNTERFOIL system using experiments on populations of two plastic dual in-line package (PDIP) chips. In our evaluation we use 52 instances of chip model AS6C6264 and 40 instances of chip model 23LC1024. Chips packaged in the same mold are identified by the mold marking on the package. Our dataset has several chips packaged from the same mold: 5 pairs, 9 multiples in chip model AS6C6264 and 14 pairs in chip model 23LC1024. Each chip instance is enrolled to the database using one camera, and then verified using the other camera of the same model. Enrollment and verification is repeated 3 times for each chip, comprising a total of 528 images taken with ViTiny and MustCam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Package Authentication</head><p>Package authentication is performed by matching verification image features with enrolled ones as described in Sec. 4. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> shows in green the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of inliers (matched keypoints) from the dataset of enrolled and verification chip images using our system. <ref type="figure">Fig. 8</ref> also shows in red the CDF of inliers for mislabeled packages. In these cases, the program is modified to ignore the identity encoded on the label, and to fetch from the database the enrolled keypoints of another, randomly selected chip instance of the same model. 5,000 such comparisons are performed. This CDF represents what a counterfeiter might achieve by randomly swapping labels. We also consider the strongest adversary that has an exact duplicate of the mold that was used by the trusted packaging house to produce the enrolled chip, and he copies the label for the legitimate enrolled chip onto his counterfeits created from the same mold. The lines in blue show the number of inliers that the counterfeit would be able to achieve in this permissive setting. Even if the attacker has the same mold used to produce an enrolled chip, the counterfeits that can be created with the mold typically still have significantly fewer inliers than the enrolled chip. The verifier's decision to accept or reject a package is made according to whether the number of matched enrollment keypoints exceeds a threshold. A higher threshold is a more selective determination of authenticity. Higher thresholds can reduce both false positives (counterfeits accepted as authentic) and true positives (legitimate chips accepted as authentic). a counterfeit chip with a label that was enrolled to a chip from a different mold. The second case of false positive is a counterfeit chip with a label used to enroll another chip from the same mold as itself. The first case corresponds to a typical unsophisticated counterfeiter, and the second is to provide an idea of what a determined and well-equipped attacker may be able to achieve. The ROC curves are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. For both models of chip and both models of camera, we are able to distinguish perfectly (100% true positives at 0% false positives) between a legitimate chip being verified and a counterfeit from a different mold. Even in the extreme case where the counterfeiter has the same mold (from the packaging house) used to create the enrolled chip, it is possible to detect the counterfeits while still keeping a high rate of true positives. The worst case is AS6C6264 with ViTiny camera <ref type="figure">(Fig. 9b</ref>), where it is still possible to accept 90% of legitimate chips while allowing only 10% of counterfeits created from the same mold. We will show later in the paper that this performance can be further improved by higher quality images. Note that the worst-case scenario of counterfeits from the same mold that produces legitimate chips demonstrates the effectiveness of COUNTERFOIL, but our assumption of a trusted packaging house precludes an adversary having this capability.</p><p>COUNTERFOIL is intended to be a scalable solution for provenance, so it is important to consider the possibility of collisions when enrolling fingerprints of many packages. Because the packaging house in possession of the molds is trusted, we focus on collisions that might occur in the ordinary scenario of a profit-seeking attacker that is using different molds to create counterfeit chips. A collision occurs when a verification fingerprint of package (A) is accepted as matching enrolled fingerprints from two different-mold packages (A) and (B). This collision is a true positive authentication of package (A), and a false positive authentication of package (A) against the enrolled fingerprint of (B). We are able to avoid false positives between different-mold chips in our limited dataset, so we use a simple model to estimate the false positive probability of a larger dataset. Enrolled fingerprints have an average of 3936 keypoints in a 2mm 2 ROI, and we find empirically that each keypoint will become an inlier with probability 1.0E-3 when compared to a verification fingerprint from a different mold. Under the simplifying assumption that all keypoints have the same probability of being inliers, the number of inliers will follow a binomial distribution, and we can calculate the probability of inliers falsely exceeding the acceptance threshold. We choose for the model an acceptance threshold equal to the minimum number of inliers between same-chip comparisons, which is 48. The probability of having a false positive is then 5.6E-36, which is the estimated collision probability between two fingerprints from different molds. A collision probability of 5.6E-36 implies that the enrolled fingerprints have entropy of 117-bit random binary strings. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Runtime</head><p>Verifying provenance of packages should not slow manufacturing (for enroller) or integration (for verifier). The verification process is more computationally intensive than enrollment, and certain target applications for verification may impose stringent latency requirements. For example, we envision that one application is integration with a pick-and-place machine, which removes chips from feeder reels and places them appropriately onto printed circuit board pads for reflow soldering. Single head pick-and-place machines from a leading manufacturer place between 1,800 and 5,000 parts per hour <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, which corresponds to handling each part for 720ms to 2s. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> shows that package verification can be performed at production speed, as our system is able to authenticate each instance within 150 ms on an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2690. The runtime can be further reduced to meet even tighter latency requirements by enrolling a smaller number keypoints for each chip. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref> shows how runtime scales with the size of ROI at a constant keypoint density, and shows the breakdown of runtime by task. Enrolling a larger area of the chip surface increases the number of inliers and the total runtime. The next two subsections consider the runtime implications of algorithm choices. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> compares the runtime and authentication performance of four popular algorithms for feature extraction and matching. While all of the algorithms are suitable, we find ORB to perform best, and have thus chosen it for our work. In particular, the speedup of ORB comes largely from its compatibility of using locality-based hashing to identify near neighbors, without using the k-nearest neighbor search which is the most time consuming operation in the other algorithms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Digital Signatures</head><p>We also evaluate the performance impact of using different digital signature algorithms such as DSA (3072-bit key) and ECDSA (256-bit key). For the one-time key generation step,  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>: Runtime of verification procedure, broken down by processing task, for different sizes of ROI. Keypoint density is held constant at 1,000/mm 2 . The increase in keypoints for the larger ROI results in a higher runtime, but also increases the number of matching points that are found. Runtime can be traded against accuracy by adjusting the ROI size.</p><p>ECDSA is significantly faster than DSA, with runtimes of 1.1ms and 2142ms respectively. More important is the runtime of the repeated steps of signing enrollment records and verifying signatures. Signing and verifying incur runtimes of 1.4ms and 1.6ms in DSA, and incur runtimes of 1ms and 2.6ms in ECDSA. Verification is the step with real-time constraints, so we use DSA over ECDSA, but the impact of this choice is minor because runtime is dominated by image processing. Further, signature verification can be done in parallel with feature verification and is not the performance bottleneck of COUNTERFOIL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Practicality and Costs</head><p>The COUNTERFOIL methodology is compatible as an addon to existing supply chains, and the cost at scale should be significantly less than one cent per chip. Chip verifiers can use the inexpensive camera models from our experiments, and perform processing on dedicated or shared computers. Given that verification would likely be performed at PCB assembly houses, the small cost of the camera would be insignificant, especially when amortized over a large number of boards being produced. The labels affixed to the chips cost $0.30 per sheet, and we print 1024 markers per sheet, for a per-unit cost of $0.0003 per label. The enrolled data for each chip is 1 MB, which at current hard-drive prices of $0.03 per GB corresponds to a per-unit cost of $0.00003 for storing the data. Affixing markers to each chip is currently a manual and time-consuming process. At scale we imagine that per-chip labels could be replaced by labels on part reels, or other ways of communicating a purported identity for the parts that would be used to access the signed enrollment records. In that case, the ROI would be identified based on image recognition of package surface instead of the markers. The low barriers to adoption of COUNTERFOIL are simply having a packaging house deploy the technology, and establishing keys for signing and verifying chips. Even if only a small fraction of purchasers would verify their chips using the available information, this should increase the risk of detection for distributors that traffic in possible counterfeits. The more significant barrier to adoption is perhaps the possibility that superficial cosmetic damage to parts could cause them to become untrusted, representing a monetary loss and a harm to branding.</p><p>Note that COUNTERFOIL is specifically targeted toward preventing inauthentic parts from being installed onto printed circuit boards of a system, and doing so without trusting distributors. The reliance on surface imaging makes the approach less compatible with authentication by intermediate distributors between packaging and deployment. Distributors that deal with parts in bulk will not ordinarily handle individual chips in a way that is conducive to surface imaging for COUN-TERFOIL.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Camera Differences</head><p>Because enrollment and verification are performed using different camera instances, ability to match features may be impacted by differences in the lens, lighting, or the sensor array <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> of the cameras. To explore this further, we now evaluate how the matching performance changes in the unrealistic scenario of using the same ViTiny camera instance for both enrollment and verification of AS6C6264 chips, which was the most challenging authentication case in the prior experiments (see <ref type="figure">Fig 9b)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> shows that using a consistent camera causes the number of inliers to increase, both in the case of same-chip comparisons and same-mold comparisons. The same-chip comparisons have a larger increase, and the overlap between the two distributions is reduced, implying capability for better authentication performance. This result reveals the presence of some detrimental camera variations that are being overcome in our realistic authentications that use different camera instances for verification and enrollment. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 12</ref> shows results under different magnification and lighting conditions using the ViTiny camera with the AS6C6264 chips using a smaller dataset with 10 chip instances. The approach is largely unaffected by lighting changes, but changing the magnification from enrollment to verification has some impact on the number of inliers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Further Investigation of Fingerprints</head><p>In this section we deviate from our standard system to investigate package fingerprint properties that cannot easily be evaluated within the overall system. In particular, for different reasons, experiments in this section define the ROI in a way that doesn't rely on affixed labels. Instead of defining the center of the ROI as being at position &lt; r, θ &gt; relative to the marker (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>), the center of the ROI is here defined as a pixel in the center of the image. To ensure that the same area of the chip is always imaged, the chip is aligned carefully to the camera. Aside from lacking markers, the image processing performed is as described in Sec. 4. is washed out between experiments, and each trial uses new grit and clean water. After tumbling, the chip is removed, rinsed under a faucet, dried and imaged for verification. The prototype adhesive labels do not survive the rock tumbler, so the ROI in the images is instead found by careful alignment of the chip under the camera. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13</ref> shows the degradation in number of inliers for chips after different amounts of time in the tumbler. The plot shows a slow decrease in the number of inliers after tumbling with a few hundred inliers left after an hour in the tumbler. The dashed line on the plot shows the acceptance threshold that has a 95 percent probability of rejecting a different chip from the same mold. In other words, an attacker that has obtained the same mold and produced new chips from it will have only a 5% of exceeding this threshold and thereby succeeding in forgery. Even after significant wear, most authentication trials from the legitimate chip are able to exceed this value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Testing Resilience of Fingerprints</head><p>Figs. 13b and 13c show package surfaces before and after 1 hour in the tumbler. Note that these images are illustrative; they use a different magnification from the results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13a</ref> and include the corners of the chip where the wear is most noticeable, instead of showing only the ROI where the wear is less apparent. We also tested the effect of temperature by heating the chips to 170 • C for an hour in a thermal chamber, but saw no change in the number of inliers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Testing Fingerprint Uniqueness</head><p>Any complex physical object has some combination of minute features that are unlike all other instances of the same object. Given that molded integrated circuit packages are heterogeneous mixtures of particles, they are certain to be unique in this trivial, physical, sense. However, for authentication the relevant question is whether there is a uniqueness that is observable and stable at the scale of our imaging. In studying uniqueness, we pay special attention to chips that are produced from the same mold. Fortunately, each chip bears a mold mark that is imprinted in a circle on the underside of the chip. The mold mark, as is visible in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 13b</ref>, gives a code of one letter and two numbers. The marks are used for traceability within the packaging facility, so that problematic molds can be identified. Our experiments confirm that chips with the same mark are from the same mold, as they show a distinct similarity according to our analysis, and in fact a similar texture can be observed at high magnification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.1">Scoring under Controlled Alignment</head><p>Experiments that use imprecisely placed labels to define the ROI of each chip cannot definitively show whether package fingerprints are unique. Two packages that are identical would appear unique if their labels are placed in such a way that their ROIs are disjoint regions of the package surface. We again avoid relying on markers and perform experiments in which ROI is based on chip alignment underneath the camera. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 14</ref> shows the result. Different chip instances from the same mold do show similarity, but it is smaller than the similarity between two images of the same chip. In chip type AS6C6264, the highest score between any two images of different chips from the same mold is 277 inliers, whereas the lowest score between any two images of the same chip is 603 inliers; the means are 113 and 825 respectively. The clear difference in scores for same-mold and same-chip comparisons is significant, as it shows that the mold surface texture is not entirely responsible for the fingerprints. Even if an adversary were able to perfectly reproduce (or steal) the mold, they will be unable to create high quality forged packages with it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">PUF-like Evaluation using Pixel Intensity</head><p>We also consider evaluating similarity of package fingerprints using a standard Physically Unclonable Function(PUF)-like scheme rather than the computer vision based techniques used in COUNTERFOIL. As standard PUF metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> based on Hamming distance are not directly applicable in this setting, distance comparisons between enrollment and verification images are made by comparing the 8-bit pixel intensities of the two ROIs on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which is analogous to comparing responses from weak PUFs on a bit-by-bit basis.</p><p>The major challenge in making this comparison is that, unlike in digital PUFs, when comparing images there is no ground truth about which pixel in the verification image should be compared against which pixel in the enrollment image. Even if the package appears identical in the two images, the pixel-by-pixel comparison will only show the similarity if the two images have pixel-accurate alignment. Aside from requiring pixel-accurate alignment in the X and Y directions, rotation and scale variance additionally cannot be tolerated. Still, with some difficulty, we can partially overcome these challenges to make a pixel-by-pixel comparison. To make the comparison, we start from images taken using controlled alignment. A brute-force search is then performed to find the X and Y offset that best aligns the images, as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15b</ref>. Only when the alignment is correct to within a few pixels does the similarity between the images become apparent. The need to perform brute force search for alignment increases runtime to 10s per comparison, which is hundreds of times slower than COUNTERFOIL, and still unable to handle any change to rotation or scale. The results from making hundreds of comparisons in this manner are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 15a</ref>. In some cases, presumably due to rotation or scale, the similarity between the same-chip images cannot be found using pixel-by-pixel comparisons. This result confirms that the package features can with some difficulty be observed in a PUF like way, but also shows that pixel-by-pixel comparisons are not well-suited to this task relative to the computer vision approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.3">PUF-like Evaluation using Feature Distance</head><p>In COUNTERFOIL, the number of matches that we compute as inliers is based on both feature similarity, and the geometric relationship of the features on the package surface, as matched keypoints from enrollment and verification must be related by a homography. One might also consider evaluating similarity of the features in corresponding positions of two chip packages, similar to Hamming Distance between corresponding bits in a PUF circuit. In this case, the computer vision approach is being used to align the enrollment and verification keypoints, but after alignment is decided the corresponding features are scored according to their similarity in feature space instead of their pixel intensity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16</ref> shows the average distance, in feature space, between features having positional correspondence defined by computed homography. In a highly controlled setting of careful alignment, lighting and single camera, the same package can be distinguished from packages created from the same mold, as shown by the separation between the feature distances in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16a</ref>. However, in the general setting which contains typical image quality variations, the same chip distribution is shifted to the right leading to a slight overlap with the same mold distribution as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 16a</ref>. An absolute feature distance threshold to distinguish between chips from same mold is therefore not robust to image quality variations. COUNTERFOIL aims to avoid this limitation by using feature similarity ranking (nearest neighbors) instead of an absolute distance threshold. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Additional Package Types</head><p>To further validate package surface fingerprints, we conduct experiments with 10 additional circuit package types. As before, one ViTiny camera is used for enrollment, and a second for verification. We use 5 instances of each chip, and from each instance collect 5 enrollment and 5 verification images. Note that, among the molded packages in this secondary population, none appear to be from the same mold. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> summarizes the results of the experiment. Because many of the packages are quite small, and we want to use an unmarked area of the package surface as the fingerprint, in some cases the enrolled area of the surface is smaller than 2mm 2 . ROI is identified by manual chip alignment under the camera, as many of the packages are impractically small for   the crude adhesive markers used in our prototype demonstration. The table gives for each chip an example image with the ROI marked by a square. To give a sense of the surface structure of each package model, we plot within the table the deviation from nominal surface height along an arbitrary 0.9mm trace of the surface; this data is collected with the same Zygo Nexview 3D optical surface profiler used to generate <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3a</ref>.</p><p>The significant distance between the average number of inliers for same chip and different chip comparisons implies that it may be possible to authenticate most of the plastic packages by their fingerprints, although further experiments would be needed to give confidence. Interestingly, based on this preliminary data, the ceramic package (14-CDIP) also appears to have identifying features. Two packages that are notably unsuitable for the style of package fingerprinting used in this paper are the final two entries in the table -the TO-39 metal can package and 20-WLCSP wafer-level package. In these two cases, the reflective surfaces cause very few keypoints to be extracted from the image, and the extracted keypoints do not match well between enrollment and verification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper we have presented COUNTERFOIL, a system that verifies provenance by extracting unique fingerprints from surface features of integrated circuit packages imaged using inexpensive cameras. The work is a low-cost strategy that can help to address the significant problem of counterfeit integrated circuits which results in billions of dollars of losses each year. Our approach enrolls unique features of each chip after packaging, and requires no chain-of-custody through distribution. During verification features are matched against cryptographically signed enrollment records. We've demonstrated the approach to work on a large population of two different chips, have used different models of low-cost microscope cameras, and have evaluated resiliency of fingerprints. Crucially, we've shown that even an adversary possessing an exact duplicate of the mold used to produce a chip's package will not easily be able to create a high-quality counterfeit of the chip.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Transfer molding is the mechanism used for packaging most high-volume microchips.</figDesc></figure>
