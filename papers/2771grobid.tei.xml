				<p>Building dependable federated systems is often complicated by privacy concerns: if the domains are not willing to share information with each other, a global or &apos;sys-temic&apos; threat may not be detected until it is too late. In this paper, we study this problem using a somewhat unusual example: the financial crisis of 2008. Based on results from the economics literature, we argue that a) the impending crisis could have been predicted by performing a specific distributed computation on the financial information of each bank, but that b) existing tools, such as secure multiparty computation, do not offer enough privacy to make participation safe from the banks&apos; perspective. We then sketch the design of a system that can perform this (and possibly other) computation at scale with strong privacy guarantees. Results from an early prototype suggest that the computation and communication costs are reasonable.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In distributed systems, federation is often an obstacle to dependability. When different parts of a system belong to different administrative domains, there is no single entity that has a view of the entire system, and domains are often reluctant to share information with each other because they can have conflicting interests. As a consequence, when a federated system faces a "global" problem that no single domain can detect by itself, the problem may not be recognized until it is too late.</p><p>Several instances of this problem have appeared in "technical" distributed systems. For instance, botnets can spread their command-and-control infrastructure across multiple networks to avoid raising suspicion <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, administrative systems can drop or degrade certain types of traffic while feeling reasonably safe that the behavior will not be attributed to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, and interdomain routing protocols can fail to find good solutions, even when they would benefit everyone involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In many cases, specialized solutions have been developed that enable the domains to coordinate on a particular instance.</p><p>But the problem is more general than this: it also affects distributed systems in the offline world, where the domains are organizations or businesses, rather than computers. A recent example is the 2008 financial crisis, in which a number of financial institutions had to be bailed out at great cost to governments around the world. At a very high level, this crisis arose because some banks were selling each other a form of insurance against problematic events (such as a price drop in the housing market), but were unable to tell whether their counterparties would actually be able to pay up if the event did occur. This information asymmetry created a risk of cascading failures: if an actual price drop forced a single bank into bankruptcy, that bank might not be able to meet its obligations, creating a liquidity problem for other banks. This might then trigger additional bankruptcies, potentially leading to a system-wide failure.</p><p>The classical approach to resolving such problems is to collect all the information at a trusted third party, which then performs some computation to look for problems, and publishes the result. This could have prevented the financial crisis, since the risk was knowable in principle: someone with access to the financial information of all the banks could have foreseen it <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, in practice, this information is extremely sensitive because it reveals details about the banks' strategies; hence, it is unlikely that the banks would be willing to share it willingly, and a government mandate would probably be met with fierce resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. An alternative could be the use of multiparty computation (MPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and this has in fact been considered for this scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, na¨ıvena¨ıve MPC does not scale well to large number of players (such as the global banking system) or to complex computations -and, more importantly, even MPC would not necessarily be acceptable to the banks: even if the computation itself were confidential, its output (perhaps a list of banks that are in danger of failing) might still allow conclusions about the sensitive inputs <ref type="bibr">[10, §4.2]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a new approach to this problem that we are currently working on. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, stability criteria can sometimes be distributed into a Pregel-style <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> computation on graphs -in other words, we can break it down into multiple rounds and, in each round, have each participant exchange information only with some local neighborhood. This is potentially a lot more efficient than doing all-to-all MPC; it may not be possible for all scenarios, but, as we will show in this paper, it is possible in at least the banking scenario. Our second key insight is that signs of trouble are typically large: for instance, in the banking scenario, we are not looking for small financial difficulties in individual banks, but rather for a massive systemic failure. Thus, the results do not need to be particularly precise, as long as they would reliably indicate a large problem. This imprecision greatly helps with delivering robust privacy guarantees.</p><p>In the rest of this paper, we sketch a distributed system that can support large-scale, cross-domain computations with strong, provable privacy guarantees. Our system is based on a combination of MPC, a graph-computation runtime, and differential privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. We use the 2008 financial crisis as a case study to show how our system could be applied: we adapt a computation from Bisias et al. <ref type="bibr">[3, §B3]</ref> that measures the systemic risk in a network of contracts, and we demonstrate that it could be evaluated on our system within minutes on commodity hardware, using only a few MB of traffic per participant. Although our system still has some important limitations -such as limited resilience against large-scale collusion -we believe that it can be a promising step towards improving the resilience of technical and non-technical federated systems against large-scale, systemic shocks, which would result in better dependability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Case study: Systemic risk in banking</head><p>We begin by describing a somewhat unusual example, the market for derivatives between banks, where dependability is an explicitly distributed criterion that cannot be broken down into locally detected conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Background on financial markets</head><p>To provide some context for the following discussion, we begin by explaining a (drastically simplified) model of financial markets. Banks, as part of their regular business with clients, are exposed to risk. We can think of this risk as a certain event -such as a drop in house prices -that causes the bank to lose a certain amount of money. To prevent a buildup of excess exposure to any single event, banks can create derivatives and sell them to other parties, perhaps another bank. We can think of derivatives as "insurance contracts" that specify that a certain sum will be due if and when a particular event occurs.</p><p>A bank's exposure to a single event is often more than an order of magnitude bigger than its cash reserves; this multiple is known as leverage. Thus, banks depend on the derivatives to remain solvent. However, there is a risk that, when an event occurs and the debt becomes due, the other party will be bankrupt and unable to pay. This risk is known as counterparty risk. This risk exists even for honest banks because in practice, the chances that everything will become due at the same time are usually small; therefore, no bank keeps enough money on hand to cover all of its possible obligations.</p><p>Banks regularly reinsure their risk by buying derivatives from other banks. We can think of the resulting network of obligations as a graph in which the vertices represent the banks and the edges represent the contracts. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">What is systemic risk?</head><p>A key challenge for banks is to be resilient to the possibility of a contract not paying out because the seller is bankrupt. While a bank might try to protect itself by diversifying its insurance purchases among a diverse group of sellers, it is hard for a bank to know who its dependencies depend upon. The reason is that each bank guards its "book" of investments closely, since this is its profitmaking edge. Therefore, it is possible for almost every bank to individually believe themselves to be sufficiently diversified, but in reality they could all depend on a single upstream bank, so in effect, the diversity is zero.</p><p>The bankruptcy of a single bank is often acceptable; the danger that regulators wish to prevent is that a single bankruptcy becomes a financial contagion that spreads to other banks, potentially causing cascading failures, and eventually financial collapse. We illustrate this problem in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1(b)</ref> and (c). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b) shows the state of the system after the event has occurred and a single round of contract payouts have been made. Notice how some banks did not have enough liquid cash to pay out all their obligations immediately (this is shown in red) -we assume that in this case payouts are made in proportion to the original amount of each contract, which is a modeling assumption supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(c)</ref> shows the final state once no more payouts can be made; notice how banks A, C, D, and J are unable to pay out their full obligations and thus are insolvent (shown in red at the termination of the algorithm).</p><p>We make two observations about this scenario. First, we note that a small initial problem at bank A has caused massive damage to the system; banks C and D are now also insolvent. Second, it is very difficult to predict this based only on the local information available at each bank. In retrospect, bank A did oversell insurance, but it is not illegal for banks to risk their own bankruptcy, and perhaps the bank's individual risk model had (incorrectly) considered the event extremely unlikely. More importantly, however, banks C, D, and J did nothing obviously wrong; they would have been fine if all their contracted payments had actually materialized. This uncertainty about the creditworthiness of other banks is thought to have contributed materially to extending the 2008 financial crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Can the risk be detected early?</head><p>Although no individual bank can estimate the risk of cascading failures based on its local information, a hypothetical entity that has access to the combined information of all banks could certainly do so. Designing indices of systemic risk is a hot topic of research since the 2008 financial crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, although many proposals are constrained by assumptions about the non-viability of centralization. We ignore this issue for now, but return to it in Section 2.4.</p><p>There are already some preliminary theoretical economic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, [3, §B.3], and they share a basic structure we will now sketch briefly. The model resembles the model we have used in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>: banks are modeled as nodes n 1 . . . n i in a graph, with respective starting capital C 1 . . .C i , and directed edges between banks represent insurance contracts. If there are m insurable events, we have a matrix E of initial exposures, where e i,k represents bank i's initial exposure to event k. Banks write contracts predicated on events: a contract d i, j,k,l says that if event k happens, bank i pays bank j l dollars.</p><p>To estimate the contagion effects of a given subset of the events, a fixpoint iteration can then be performed on this model. In each round, banks either pay out their obligations in full, or, if they are unable to do so, reduce their payment to the actual money available. This computation eventually converges, and in the final state, the number of bankrupt banks (or, alternatively, the monetary shortfall) can then be measured. The details vary somewhat between the models; for instance, the precise payment rules used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> can produce multiple equilibria depending on where the computation is started, whereas the scenario in [3, §B.3] always converges to a single unique payment equilibrium. But overall, each of these models can perform fine-grained stress tests by simulating various "what-if" events (or combinations of events). Unlike the stress tests that are mandated by law today, such stress tests can take into account the precise linkages between firms.</p><p>We emphasize that these models are works in progress: they are simple, and economists are still debating the details, e.g., the exact rule sets to use. However, it seems clear that the economic theory side of the problem is in the process of being solved -in other words, we should soon know what a hypothetical centralized entity would compute in order to estimate systemic risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Strawman solutions</head><p>One obvious way to implement such a centralized entity would be to create an all-powerful government regulator. However, this does not seem practical because banks critically rely on secrecy to protect their business practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Currently, regulatory bodies that deal with less influential information about single institutions already have extremely heavy levels of legal safeguards and multiple levels of oversight <ref type="bibr">[10, §3.1]</ref>. Congress is aware of the risks posed by having an all-powerful banking regulator, and thus is unlikely to create such an authority.</p><p>Another potential approach would be to use multiparty computation (MPC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>: one could design a circuit that has each bank's books as inputs, execute the simulation we have described above, and finally output some measure of risk, perhaps a list of banks that would fail if a certain event occurs. This approach is potentially more palatable for the banks, since they would not need to reveal their secret inputs, but it creates two additional challenges. First, MPC does not scale well with the number of participants, so even an implementation for a moderate number of big banks would probably be very expensive. Second (and perhaps more importantly for the banks), it cannot guarantee confidentiality because the output of the computation can still reveal facts about the confidential inputs through auxiliary information attacks such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. It is these two challenges that our work is intended to address.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Our approach</head><p>Our approach is based on two key insights. First, although MPC generally does not scale well with the number of participants, the algorithm from Section 2.3 is a graph algorithm: each round can be broken down into computations at each vertex (the banks' receipts and updates to debts and capital) and communication over the edges (the payments). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref> shows the algorithm in this model; we have added a final "aggregation stage" that computes the total shortfall as a metric of systemic risk. Since we expect the vertices in the banking graph to have a relatively low degree, we can hope to run the computation by performing many smaller "blocks" of MPC in parallel, which would improve scalability.</p><p>Our second key insight is that we can potentially use differential privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to address the privacy concerns about the output. Differential privacy provides strong, provable privacy guarantees, which should be reassuring to the banks. Its main cost is the addition of a small amount of imprecision to the output, but, since we are looking for early warnings of large problems, a bit of imprecision (say, a shortfall of $1 billion is reported as $0.95 billion) should not affect the utility of the results. If a potential problem is detected, a more detailed investigation could be conducted outside of our system.</p><p>In summary, the capability we aim to provide is a privacy-enabled graph computation engine for federated systems. We note that this computation model is quite general, so our solution potentially has applications beyond risk estimation in financial networks, including the examples in the introduction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Solution sketch</head><p>Overview: At a high level, our solution works as follows: Each vertex v i in the graph is associated with a specific node i that knows its initial state; in the banking example, this might be a machine node that is controlled by the corresponding bank. However, instead of letting the nodes maintain their own state and communicate di- rectly with each other , we replace each node i with a computation block B i that consists of m different nodes, including i, and we use secret sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to split i's state among the members of B i . This is necessary to ensure privacy: if i were allowed to see the intermediate state or the messages of "its" vertex v i during the computation, it could learn information about other vertices.</p><p>In each round, the members of B i use MPC to compute the state updates of v i ; if v i needs to send a message to another node v j , the members of B i break the message into shares and send the shares to B j . Thus, no single node can learn anything about the state of the computation while it is still in progress; thanks to secret sharing, even (m − 1) colluding nodes cannot decrypt any state or any messages. Once the distributed phase of the algorithm (top part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>) has completed, each computation block sends the shares of its state to a designated computation block, which can then aggregate these states, compute the final result (bottom part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>), and finally add some imprecision as required by differential privacy, e.g., using the Laplace mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> illustrates this strategy. Logically, the computation is very much like a Pregel program: vertices receive messages, update their local state, and then optionally send messages to adjacent vertices. The actual communication pattern is more complex because computations are performed by computation blocks using MPC, and messages are sent as shares. Threat model: We assume that the players are honest but curious (HbC), although they might collude with each other. This seems appropriate for our motivating scenario. However, we speculate that malicious banks could be handled as well: MPC protocols for the fully malicious setting do exist, and if a bank reports a false initial state, this could be detected by current regulators, who already have siloed views into each institution. Block assignment: At first glance, our solution would seem to require n · m nodes, where n is the number of banks and m the number of shares -but we can simply assign each node to m different computation blocks, so n nodes are sufficient. To preserve privacy, we can pick the members of each B i from different administrative domains, so that they are unlikely to collude. Message passing: A na¨ıvena¨ıve approach for passing messages between two computation blocks B i and B j would be to have each member of B i send its share to a member of B j , who inputs it into the MPC for the next round. But this would decrease collusion resistance: m members from B i B j would be sufficient to decrypt the message. Instead, each node in B i re-shares its own share to get m new shares and then sends each of them to one member of B j . Having m 2 shares for each message may sound expensive, but in fact, with an XOR-based secret sharing scheme, the operations are quite cheap -although of course the message complexity remains at m 2 . Noising: To prevent individual nodes from controlling (or knowing) the noise that is added at the end to achieve differential privacy, we can ask each node to generate some random bits, and XOR them together in the final step to generate the random draw from the Laplace distribution. The draw itself can be performed in MPC without having to resort to expensive floating-point computations, using algorithms such as those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Initial results</head><p>To see whether our approach is practical, we built a simple prototype. Our prototype runs all the nodes on a single physical machine (an Ubuntu 12.04 Linux workstation with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU) and performs all the computation steps sequentially -but this is sufficient for us to measure the computation and bandwidth costs. We have written custom programs to construct the boolean circuits corresponding to the systemic risk algorithms suggested by <ref type="bibr">[3, §B.</ref>3] (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2</ref>), and the noising algorithms from <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>; for secure multi-party computation, our system uses the toolkit from Choi et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. End-to-end experiment: For a small scale end-to-end run of the proposed protocols, we set up a small banking network with 10 financial institutions, using three-note computation blocks and synthetic initial data for each bank's capital and contracts. We ran 10 computation rounds, followed by the final aggregation/noising round, and we measured the amount of computation and traffic per bank. We found that each bank performed between 37.9 and 40.6 seconds worth of computation, and sent between 9.1 and 9.5 MB of traffic. Scalability: To better gauge the computation and bandwidth costs that would be incurred in a real-size banking network, we performed a series of microbenchmarks. We constructed the circuit of the main computation step for networks of 10 − 100 banks, and we varied the size of the computation blocks from 3 to 16 nodes. As expected for MPC, the bandwidth cost increased quadratically with the size of the computation blocks. In the most expensive case, a single main computation step for 100 banks with a block size of 16 nodes took 15 seconds to complete, and required the transfer of 18.31 MB per node. Summary: Although the costs are nontrivial, we observe that the costs per bank depend only on the size of the computation block (which depends on the assumptions about collusion) and the complexity of the algorithm itself, but not at all on the overall size of the network -a substantial improvement over na¨ıvena¨ıve MPC that is made possible by our formulation of the algorithm as a graph algorithm. This is in addition to the qualitative improvement with respect to privacy -recall that, unlike na¨ıvena¨ıve MPC, our approach also protects against information leakage through the output of the algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Status and ongoing work</head><p>We are currently extending our prototype to a complete system that would also support other graph algorithms. Below, we sketch some of the remaining challenges. Sensitivity: Differential Privacy requires a bound on the sensitivity of a computation to determine the amount of noise to add. Our algorithm's sensitivity depends on multiple factors, such as the maximum node degree and the maximum dollar value of each contract. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> suggests dollar-privacy: a privacy guarantee that is weaker for larger banks and that makes sensitivity bounds easier to compute. It would also be useful to automatically infer the sensitivity from the algorithm, as shown, e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Privacy budget: Differential privacy systems use a "privacy budget" that controls how much information is leaked, and that is depleted as queries are answered over time. We believe that this restriction can be relaxed in the financial setting, as there is already an expectation of "eventual disclosure" in financial regulation; thus, it may be safe to slowly replenish the privacy budget over time. Structural privacy: Our algorithm as designed leaks some information about the graph that is not covered by the differential privacy guarantee. First, it leaks the degree of each node to neighboring nodes in the computation block as they send out shares to as many blocks as the owner node has outgoing links. Second, our blockgroup selection contains the owning node, which allows members of the block to narrow down the list of plausible members. We hope to mitigate or entirely prevent this in the final system.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A simplified example over three time steps.
