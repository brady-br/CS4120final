				<p>In the recent years, XML Encryption became a target of several new attacks [18, 17, 16]. These attacks belong to the family of adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks, and allow an adversary to decrypt symmetric and asymmetric XML ciphertexts, without knowing the secret keys. In order to protect XML Encryption implementations, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published an updated version of the standard. Unfortunately, most of the current XML Encryption implementations do not support the newest XML En-cryption specification and offer different XML Security configurations to protect confidentiality of the exchanged messages. Resulting from the attack complexity, evaluation of the security configuration correctness becomes tedious and error prone. Validation of the applied countermeasures can typically be made with numerous XML messages provoking incorrect behavior by decrypting XML content. Up to now, this validation was only manually possible. In this paper, we systematically analyze the chosen-ciphertext attacks on XML Encryption and design an algorithm to perform a vulnerability scan on arbitrary en-crypted XML messages. The algorithm can automatically detect a vulnerability and exploit it to retrieve the plaintext of a message protected by XML Encryption. To assess practicability of our approach, we implemented an open source attack plugin for Web Service attacking tool called WS-Attacker. With the plugin, we discovered new security problems in four out of five analyzed Web Service implementations, including IBM Datapower or Apache CXF.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The W3C standard XML Encryption ensures confidentiality of XML data, directly on the message level. It is used in security-critical scenarios like business and governmental applications, banking systems or healthcare services. Given the importance of the scenarios XML Encryption is deployed, its security becomes a crucial point.</p><p>XML Encryption is mainly used with two encryption algorithms: AES-CBC and RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5. 1 These two standards recently became targets of attacks in many practical scenarios ranging from IPSec <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and TLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to web applications and Captchas <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In 2011, it was shown that the XML Encryption standard is also vulnerable to attacks affecting confidentiality of symmetric ciphertexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. One year later, further attacks affecting public key encryption in XML Encryption were described <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The attacks belong to the family of adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks. They are applicable when the attacker is able to modify an inspected ciphertext (i.e., the ciphertext is not authenticated), send it to the server for processing, and observe the server's response. Based on this response, the attacker can decide whether the decrypted request was valid or invalid. To distinguish valid from invalid requests, he can use side channels, for example, by observing response error message or measuring response times.</p><p>In order to protect the servers against these attacks the newest XML Encryption specification proposes to use encryption schemes that are not vulnerable to adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks: AES-GCM and RSA-OAEP. However, these schemes are not widely deployed in today's XML Security frameworks and different measures have to be applied to vulnerable servers.</p><p>Typically, XML Encryption is deployed together with XML Signatures, which can be used to protect data integrity and authenticity. Nevertheless, in many cases, the XML Signature protection can be circumvented using XML Signature Wrapping and XML Encryption Wrapping techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. The idea behind these techniques is very simple: the attacker moves the signed or encrypted data to a different document part so that the encrypted data becomes unprotected. However, the complexity of the XML structure and XML processing makes it difficult to prevent from these attacks, which is underlined by a large body of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. This allows the attacker to force the server to decrypt unprotected elements, and thus practically execute the chosenciphertext attacks.</p><p>Contribution. In this paper, we first summarize possible countermeasures against the attacks on XML Encryption. We present problems connected with various configurations XML Encryption is deployed with, and how to circumvent these countermeasures. We present a systematic methodology on verifying interfaces using XML Encryption. Based on this methodology, we implement an automatic plugin for the WS-Attacker Web Service penetration testing framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> that allows one to automatically analyze Web Services interfaces and execute attacks on XML Encryption. We use our new plugin to analyze different Web Services frameworks and their application of XML Encryption. One could think that widely used Web service frameworks and commercially used XML Security Gateways are aware of the threat to XML Encryption. However, our evaluation shows that it is possible to attack frameworks like Apache CXF, 2 IBM Datapower 3 (if not configured correctly) and Axway Gateway 4 . All these frameworks implemented several methods to protect Web Services from the attacks. The protection mechanisms by Apache CXF could be successfully circumvented using XML Encryption and XML Signature Wrapping techniques. Axway Gateway and IBM Datapower offer several security configurations. However, only a few of them could be successfully applied to prevent the attacks.</p><p>Our paper once again shows that usage of insecure cryptographic algorithms (AES-CBC, RSA-PKCS#1) in complex scenarios can lead to sustainable and severe consequences (e.g., backward compatibility attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>), which can be used to expose confidential data even if specific countermeasures are applied. We thus encourage protocol and standard designers to use provably secure cryptography and prevent future specification vulnerabilities.</p><p>Even though our library is currently embedded in the WS-Attacker framework, the implemented algorithms are of general importance and can be used to analyze further XML Security standards (e.g., SAML) as well.</p><p>Responsible Disclosure. We communicated our findings to the Web Services developers. Vulnerabilities in Apache CXF are summarized under CVE-2015-0226 and CVE-2015-0227. Security best practices resulting from our discussions with IBM Datapower developers are addressed in their Flash alert <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Problems reported to the Axway security team are still under investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Foundations</head><p>In the following, we assume the reader is familiar with basic concepts behind symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Details behind the concrete cryptographic algorithms (RSA-PKCS#1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, AES-CBC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, AES-GCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) are not needed to understand this paper. We stress again that with RSA-PKCS#1, we refer to version 1.5, unless defined otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">SOAP-based Web Services</head><p>The SOAP standard describes the message exchange with a Web Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Listing 1 depicts a SOAP message example consisting of an Envelope element with two child elements named Header and Body. The SOAP Header element can contain meta information, for example, timestamps, signatures or encryption details. The SOAP Body element stores the payload that is processed by the Web Service operation. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">XML Signature</head><p>XML Signature is a W3C recommendation that defines a syntax for using digital signatures in XML messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. It is used for ensuring integrity and authenticity of XML message fragments or even the whole XML messages.</p><p>The signing process undertakes the following flow: For each XML fragment to be signed, a Reference element is created and the DigestValue of the element  referenced by the URI attribute is computed using the algorithm specified in the DigestMethod element. Afterwards, the SignedInfo element is signed using the algorithm defined in the SignatureMethod element.</p><p>For embedding an XML Signature into a SOAP message, the Signature element is placed as a child of a WS Security header as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">XML Encryption</head><p>XML Encryption is a W3C recommendation that defines structures for ensuring confidentiality on the XML message level. Similarly to XML Signature, it is possible to encrypt whole XML documents or only parts of them.</p><p>In most cases, a hybrid encryption scheme is used. Asymmetric encryption is used to encrypt a symmetric session key. The session key is then used to encrypt XML data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref> gives an example of a SOAP message containing a hybrid ciphertext. This message consists of the following parts. (1.) The EncryptedKey element with an encrypted session key k. (2.) The EncryptedData element with payload data encrypted using the session key k.</p><p>A SOAP-based Web Service processes such an XML document as follows.</p><p>It locates the EncryptionMethod and KeyInfo elements within the EncryptedKey element to retrieve the used algorithm and asymmetric decryption key. The server then decrypts the content of the CipherValue  element using RSA-PKCS#1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. After successful decryption, the content is further used as a session key k.</p><p>Afterwards, the server searches for the EncryptedData elements according to the URI in the DataReference element. It determines the needed symmetric algorithm from the EncryptionMethod element and decrypts the content of the CipherValue element with the session key k. Finally, the decrypted payload data is parsed, and put back into the XML document tree. The server can then process the plain SOAP message and respond to the client.</p><p>If an error occurs during one of the decryption steps or during the parsing process, the server typically responds with an error message to the client.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">WS-Attacker</head><p>WS-Attacker is a modular framework for Web Services penetration testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It is free, open source, and available on GitHub. 5 WS-Attacker uses a plugin architecture to execute XML-specific attacks on Web Services automatically. In its current version, WS-Attacker supports the following attacks: (1.) SOAPAction Spoofing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, (2.) WS-Addressing Spoofing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, (3.) XML Denialof-Service Attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, (4.) and XML Signature Wrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Attacks on XML Encryption</head><p>The analyzed attacks on XML Encryption belong to the family of adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks. In the following, we give a brief description of an adaptive chosenciphertext attack scenario and present basic ideas behind these attacks. Afterwards, possible countermeasures and their problems are summarized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Adaptive Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks</head><p>In an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack scenario, the attacker's goal is to decrypt a ciphertext C without any knowledge of the (symmetric or asymmetric) decryption key. To this end, he iteratively issues new ciphertexts C ,C , . . . that are somehow related to the original ciphertext C. He sends the ciphertexts to a receiver, and observes its responses. The receiver responses leak specific information about the validity of the decrypted message. With each response the attacker learns some plaintext information. He repeats these steps until he decrypts C.</p><p>Two major examples of these attacks are Vaudenay's attack on CBC-based symmetric encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref> and Bleichenbacher's attack on RSA-PKCS#1-based publickey encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Cryptographic details behind these attacks are not relevant to our paper. It is just necessary to know that the attacks against these cryptographic algorithms are applicable whenever an oracle is given that decrypts a ciphertext and responds with 1 (valid) or 0 (invalid) according to the validity of the decrypted message. A typical reason for answering with 0 is that the decrypted message contains an invalid padding. Thus, the attacks are also known as padding oracle attacks.</p><p>Recently, two works on XML Encryption were published that are based on the attacks of Vaudenay and Bleichenbacher:</p><p>Attack on symmetric ciphertexts in XML Encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>: The attack on symmetric CBC-ciphertexts generalizes the idea behind Vaudenay's padding oracle attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. The attacker exploits the behavior of XML servers, which need to parse XML messages after they are decrypted. In case the message cannot be parsed, the server responds with a failure, which gives the attacker a hint on message validity. This enables to perform a highly efficient attack and decrypt one encrypted byte by issuing only 14 server queries on average.</p><p>Attack on asymmetric ciphertexts in XML Encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: The attack on asymmetric ciphertexts completely breaks confidentiality of the exchanged symmetric keys encrypted with the RSA-PKCS#1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> padding scheme. The gained symmetric key enables the attacker to decrypt the symmetric ciphertext in the XML message. The attacker can determine validity of the modified RSA-PKCS#1 ciphertext by an invalid server response, which is triggered when, for example, the RSA-PKCS#1 ciphertext decrypts to a symmetric key of an invalid length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">XML Signature as a Countermeasure</head><p>The attacks on XML Encryption are only applicable if: (1.) The server supports RSA-PKCS#1 or Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation. (2.) The attacker can force the server to process modified ciphertexts and receive responses based on the message validity. The first aspect can be solved by deploying ciphers secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks. XML Encryption supports RSA-OAEP and AES-GCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, these two ciphers are not well-integrated in common Web Service frameworks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> This forces the developers to use RSA-PKCS#1 and CBC <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The second point can be solved by protecting authenticity of the exchanged ciphertexts with XML Signatures. However, this countermeasure brings several problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, which are briefly discussed in the following. For this purpose, please consider <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>, which depicts an encrypted and signed SOAP message.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">XML Signature Wrapping (XSW)</head><p>The XML Signature Wrapping attack was first presented in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The basic idea behind this attack is to move signed elements in a different part of the XML tree and force the processing logic to evaluate newly defined elements. (2.) It decrypts the newly defined EncryptedData element with Id="oracle", since this element is referenced in EncryptedKey. This allows the attacker to insert arbitrary content into the EncryptedData element and execute the attack on symmetric cipher. Note that applying the XSW attack technique requires to find a valid position to move the originally signed element <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Therefore, the attacker has to send several messages until the message is accepted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">XML Encryption Wrapping (XEW)</head><p>The XML Encryption Wrapping attack follows a similar principle as XML Signature Wrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and enforces the decryption logic to decrypt unauthenticated XML contents. The attacker achieves this by defining new EncryptedData in the SOAP Header element, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>.</p><p>As can be seen in the figure, the attacker does not move the original SOAP Body element with its content. This enables the Web Service to verify and decrypt the original SOAP Body. However, the Web Service additionally decrypts also a newly defined EncryptedData element with Id="oracle", since the EncryptedKey element contains a DataReference with URI="#oracle".</p><p>There are few variations of this attack. It is for example also possible to define a completely new EncryptedKey element with a DataReference URI="#oracle". This is applicable to servers processing only one EncryptedData for each EncryptedKey element.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Protecting EncryptedKey Element</head><p>EncryptedKey element is typically not protected by XML Signatures in Web Services scenarios, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>. However, by modifying the EncryptedKey content the symmetric key changes, which leads to a failure in symmetric data decryption. If the server responds with unified error messages, the attacker is not able to distinguish whether an error results from invalid EncryptedKey or invalid EncryptedData decryption.</p><p>Jager et al. have shown several ways to distinguish the source of decryption failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. One of them is to provoke direct messages by defining a new EncryptedKey element without any DataReference. This results in decryption of a sym-metric key, however this symmetric key is not used further for symmetric data decryption. Thus, the server responds with a failure if and only if the EncryptedKey is invalid. This allows an attacker to distinguish valid from invalid asymmetric ciphertexts.</p><p>A valid countermeasure against the attacks on PKCS#1 ciphertexts is to generate a random symmetric key every time the decryption fails, and use this key for further processing steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. This prevents from distinguishing valid from invalid PKCS#1 ciphertexts in protocols like TLS. However, Jager et al. have shown that this countermeasure does not apply to XML Encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: the attacker can use validity of CBC ciphertexts as a side channel to distinguish valid from invalid PKCS#1 ciphertexts. This attack results in several millions of server queries and becomes impractical. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Automatic XML Encryption Attack</head><p>We have implemented the described attacks on XML Encryption as a plugin for WS-Attacker. This section gives a high-level overview on our implementation and highlights some noteworthy facts and problems we faced during our design and implementation phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">About Attack Complexity</head><p>Before we describe how to break XML Encryption automatically, we need to spot on the complexity of the attack and its prerequisites. The root of the complexity is founded in different XML Security components, for example, timestamps, signed, as well as encrypted elements. To be more precise, an XML document can contain XML Signatures that do not protect encrypted elements but are used to prevent replay attacks. If the to be decrypted XML document contains a nonce or a timestamp that is signed, XSW must be applied to this document part. There can also be XML Signatures that protect encrypted elements as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>. To be able to run the XML Encryption attack, XSW or XEW must be applied on this document part.</p><p>Regarding <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4</ref>, we already presented one possible XSW vector. This is however only one vector. XSW is a very complex attack on its own and there can exist a large number of possible vector adaptations. Each of these vectors has to be sent to the Web Service in order to find a working solution, which enlarges the attack complexity by the number of possible XSW vectors. We refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> for more details.</p><p>Let us consider a typical scenario where a SOAP message includes an encrypted SOAP Body. The message contains one EncryptedKey and one EncryptedData element. The EncryptedData element is protected by an XML Signature, together with a Timestamp element. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> We assume that the XML Signature uses ID-based referencing mechanism, which was described in Section 2.2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> This assumption allows us to implicate that the XSW and XEW attacks have always the same number of attack vectors (=n). This is because both attacks in general use the same wrapping positions.</p><p>If we want to attack the EncryptedData element in this scenario, we first need to circumvent the XML Signature that protects the Timestamp. We assume n possible XSW vectors for this. We then need to circumvent the XML Signature that protects the EncryptedData element, which results in further n possibilities. If the second XSW fails, we can try to use the XML Encryption Wrapping on the EncryptedData element. We can again assume n possibilities for this. In total, we have to send 3 · n messages to a Web Service for detecting whether we can construct an XML decryption oracle from a Web Service. The concrete number of n scales with the document's total element number -typical values are 250 − 5, 000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, thus we have to send up to 15, 000 messages.</p><p>If the XML Signature countermeasures could be successfully circumvented, we have to send differently formatted ciphertexts to the server. We then have to map the real server responses to responses produced by an oracle (valid and invalid). Once the mapping is provided, the attack can be executed. The complexity of the XML Encryption attacks was analyzed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The number of attack queries depends on the encryption scheme the attack is targeting. The attack on symmetric encryption scheme (AES-CBC) takes about 14 server queries per decrypted plaintext byte. The attack on RSA-PKCS#1 needs to issue from 20,000 to several millions of server queries, depending on the given side channel (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for more details). Detection Phase. The encrypted XML document is the input for the whole process. In the detection phase, the document is analyzed offline and security elements are identified. This includes the identification of signatures, encrypted document parts, as well as timestamps. The results are stored in the knowledge pool, so that other components can access them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Attack Workflow</head><p>Avoid Phase. The avoid phase is online. Its goal is to avoid the protection of the input document so that it is possible to: (1.) send several messages to the Web Service (circumvent replay protection) and (2.) manipulate the encrypted part that is going to be decrypted (circumvent its authenticity).</p><p>To fulfill these goals, the knowledge pool is first asked whether the document contains a signed timestamp. In this case, XSW is performed. More precisely, different XSW vectors are created in order to update the timestamp and sent to the Web Service. If no XSW is possible, the attack is aborted.</p><p>In the following step, the knowledge pool is asked whether the document contains an encrypted element that is protected by a signature. If the encrypted element is protected, further XSW and XEW steps follow. If either the XSW or the XEW step is successful, the attacker is able to modify the encrypted document part, and execute an identify oracle step. Otherwise, the attack is aborted and cannot be applied.</p><p>Finally, the last step in this phase identifies the oracle to perform the attack. Depending on the attacked XML part (asymmetric or symmetric), XML messages are prepared in order to provoke an error behavior in the Web Service processing (e.g., invalid RSA-PKCS#1 padding or unparsable XML character). The generated messages are then sent to the Web Service. At the end, the attacker needs to provide a mapping between the response and the oracle answer 1 and 0. This mapping is saved in the knowledge pool.</p><p>Attack Phase. In the attack phase, the Web Service is used as an oracle to execute an attack on symmetric <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> or asymmetric <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> encryption scheme. During the attack execution, adapted XML ciphertexts are created and sent to the Web Service. The received responses are evaluated using the configured knowledge pool and transformed to a 1 or 0 oracle response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Integration into WS-Attacker</head><p>According to the fully automatic approach of WSAttacker to penetrate Web Services, we developed a WSAttacker plugin for XML Encryption attacks. Our plugin is open source as well and is distributed with WSAttacker on GitHub.</p><p>The new plugin can be configured with different attack parameters for attacking XML Encryption. After the detection phase we automatically get an overview of the encrypted elements, their relations and countermeasures. The collected information has effect on the further configuration of the avoid phase and attack phase. The first step is to choose an encrypted element. Then, we can proceed with further configuration in order to reduce the complexity of the attack, and thus reduce the total number of messages sent to the Web Service:</p><p>Wrapping Attack. Setting to use only XSW or XEW attack in order to prefer one specific type. Otherwise, both wrapping attack types are used.</p><p>StringCompare and Threshold Errors. Different server responses can be mapped to the same oracle response. This is because real server responses can include message specific data like nonces or timestamps. In order to omit comparison problems, the algorithm uses different string comparison methods (e.g., Levensthein or Dice coefficient) <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. During the attack execution, the comparison methods are used to compare the actual server response with the ones saved in the knowledge pool to get the 1/0 oracle mapping, according to a configured threshold.</p><p>PKCS#1 Strategy. As discussed in Section 3.2.3, there are different strategies to provoke error messages while applying an attack on EncryptedKey. One of them is a NoKeyRef strategy. This strategy defines a new EncryptedKey element that is not used further by any EncryptedData. Furthermore, the setting allows one to choose a CbcWeak strategy, which exploits a combination of weaknesses in RSA-PKCS#1 and AES-CBC, more details can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Practical Evaluation</head><p>We used our implemented WS-Attacker plugin for attacking different XML Encryption implementations. We first analyzed default server configurations. After we found a successful attack, we further investigated possibilities for extended countermeasures. The summary of our results is reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and provides information on the number of server queries and the applied attack type (XSW / XEW / NoKeyRef / Direct). Direct attack type indicates that there is no attack strategy needed and the attack works directly. Please note that attacks on PKCS#1 ciphertexts are always applicable when the attacks on CBC ciphertexts are possible, as discussed in Section 3.2.3. However, the attacks become impractical, since the attacker needs to issue several millions of server queries. Thus, we do not consider them in our practical evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Apache Axis2</head><p>Web Service security standards in Apache Axis2 are provided by the Apache Rampart library. For testing purposes, we used the delivered Apache Rampart samples 5 and 6, which use XML Encryption and XML Signature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">PKCS#1 Attack</head><p>The attack on PKCS#1 ciphertexts was applicable only to an older Apache Axis2 1.6.0 version, and needed about 55,000 server queries to decrypt a symmetric key. The current version (1.6.2) was not vulnerable to the attacks. This is because the underlying libraries generate a random symmetric key in case the PKCS#1 decryption fails. This prevents from practical attacks, see Section 3.2.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">CBC Attack</head><p>Both configurations could be attacked using XEW. We are not aware of any configuration that would protect against these attacks in the current version.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Apache CXF</head><p>For our tests we used a sample that applies XML Signature and XML Encryption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1">PKCS#1 Attack</head><p>The PKCS#1 attack could be applied thanks to an XSW attack combined with a NoKeyRef strategy. This means the EncryptedKey contained no reference to EncryptedData. In case of an incorrect EncryptedKey, a random symmetric key was generated in order to prevent further side channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The algorithm looked for the first EncryptedData structure referenced by the EncryptedKey and generated a random symmetric key for this EncryptedData. Since there was no EncryptedData referenced in our attack message, the server attempted to generate a random key for a default AES-128 algorithm. However, the server incorrectly generated a key of a 128-byte length (instead of 128 bits), which led to an internal exception and a different server response.</p><p>We reported this problem to the developers, who analyzed this incorrect behavior. The problem was fixed in versions 1.6.17 and 2.0.2 of the underlying WSS4J library.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">CBC Attack</head><p>The default configuration could be attacked using XSW and XEW attacks.</p><p>In addition, we tested the server for further countermeasures. Apache CXF allows one to apply a configuration attribute, 9 which ensures that the authenticity of the encrypted content is verified prior to decryption. With our new attack plugin, we found out that this countermeasure could be circumvented using an XSW attack.</p><p>We again reported this vulnerability to the Apache CXF developers. The XSW problem was then fixed in Apache CXF versions 1.6.17 and 2.0.2 of the underlying WSS4J library so that configuration attribute can now be used securely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Axway Gateway</head><p>For deployment of XML Signature and XML Encryption, Axway Gateway provides several configurations. We first applied the default configuration that allows for decryption and verification of arbitrary elements. Afterwards, we analyzed possible countermeasures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">PKCS#1 Attack</head><p>It was possible to apply a direct attack using differences in error messages, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 7</ref>. We found out that the server responded with a unified SOAP error message in a case we sent an invalid EncryptedKey. On the other hand, an EncryptedKey with a correctly formatted PKCS#1 message led to a simple HTTP Error message. This was because the server decrypted a symmetric key, which was of an invalid length so it could not be used to decrypt EncryptedData, or the decrypted symmetric key had a valid length but EncryptedData was decrypted to an unparsable content. This allowed us to distinguish valid from invalid messages and apply a Bleichenbacher attack directly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">CBC Attack</head><p>As mentioned above, the server responds with different error messages in cases where EncryptedData decryption fails. In order to modify ciphertexts in EncryptedData elements, XSW or XEW attacks were necessary. This allowed us to distinguish error messages and apply an attack against the symmetric encryption scheme.</p><p>As can be seen in the table, the attack needs about 23 queries to decrypt one byte. This number differs from the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and results from a different XML parsing approach used in the gateway. More precisely, the parser accepts decrypted content if and only if the content contains at least one valid character (in comparison to an empty string, which is accepted by the parsers analyzed in the original paper). For this reason, 9 requireSignedEncryptedDataElements = "true" we needed extend the original algorithm to handle this stricter XML parsing property, which resulted in a higher number of attack requests. Its description is behind the scope of this article.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Countermeasures</head><p>Axway Gateway offers several XPath expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to define concrete positions of signed and encrypted elements. However, most of these default expressions are insecure and allow us to apply XSW or XEW attacks.</p><p>In order to defend the CBC attack, it is possible to deploy the following secure configuration and define:</p><p>What must be signed? /soap:Envelope/ soap:Body to ensure that all the Body elements are signed.</p><p>Nodes to decrypt? /soap:Envelope/soap: Body/enc:EncryptedData to ensure that only EncryptedData elements inside of the (signed) Body element is decrypted. Others are ignored. This is however not a solution for the PKCS#1 attack, since the attacker is still able to modify EncryptedKey elements. In order to protect from this attack, the user has to additionally unify the outgoing error messages. Another countermeasure would be to generate random symmetric keys in case the PKCS#1 decryption fails, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and deployed by other analyzed frameworks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">IBM Datapower</head><p>We tested IBM Datapower XI50 with the Firmware XI50.6.0.0.2. We first used the default configuration with XML Signature and XML Encryption for SOAP messages, which was vulnerable to the attack on CBC ciphertexts. Afterwards, we analyzed possible countermeasures together with IBM developers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.1">PKCS#1 Attack</head><p>We were not able to apply the attack on PKCS#1 ciphertexts. We analyzed the Datapower server logs and found out that Datapower generates a random symmetric key every time the PKCS#1 decryption fails. This makes the PKCS#1 attacks impractical, see Section 3.2.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.2">CBC Attack</head><p>By default, IBM Datapower decrypts all the EncryptedData elements in the document.</p><p>If the decryption of an EncryptedData element fails, the server just responds with the original encrypted content. Otherwise, the server proceeds with the decrypted message and its response differs. This allowed us to apply attacks on CBC ciphertexts. To overcome the XML Signature protection, we used the XEW technique.</p><p>As can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we needed about 23 server queries to decrypt one plaintext byte. This is because IBM Datapower uses a parsing mechanism that is similar to the one used by Axway Gateway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.3">Countermeasures</head><p>We discussed several countermeasures with IBM developers. It turned out that it is possible to restrict positions of EncryptedData elements that are going to be decrypted, similarly to the Axway Gateway. In order to achieve this, the server administrator has to choose Selected Elements (Field-Level) in the configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Microsoft WCF</head><p>Microsoft WCF was not vulnerable to the investigated attacks. This framework allows a developer to define three different protection levels: EncryptAndSign, Sign, Unprotected.</p><p>For our tests we used the EncryptAndSign profile, which applies a very strict XML processing. First, there is no possibility of including an additional EncryptedKey or EncryptedData element, to enforce decryption. Second, signatures are strictly verified only on specified fields. There is no possibility to apply an XSW attack. Third, the error messages do not reveal any confidential data relevant to our attacks.</p><p>Thereby, Microsoft WCF provides a very good example on how to handle WS-Security: the configuration is secure by default, without a need of complex developer steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Research related to this paper can be divided into three parts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Security of Web Services. In 2005, McIntosh and</head><p>Austel found the first XML Signature Wrapping Attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This attack concept was later adopted on Amazon's Web Services <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, but without any automatism or tool support. In 2012, WS-Attacker was developed as a first tool supporting Web Service specific attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and was then extended by plugins for Denial-of-Service <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and XML Signature Wrapping attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. XML Encryption. Our paper is based on the attacks on symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes in XML Encryption <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. These works cover cryptographic background behind the attacks and explain how to apply them in simple scenarios where XML Signatures are used to protect message authenticity. A complete analysis of countermeasures that have to be applied against these attacks was published in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>As a response to the attacks, W3C working group included an AES-GCM algorithm into the newest XML Encryption 1.1 specification and recommends to use RSA-OAEP. However, an analysis of Jager et al. revealed that there are still possibilities for backwards compatibility attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Adaptive Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks. In 1998, Bleichenbacher presented an attack on RSA-PKCS#1 encryption scheme <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and its application to the SSL protocol. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Bardou et al. improved Bleichenbacher's attack, and applied it to PKCS#11-based environments, e.g. Hardware Security Modules. In 2014, Meyer et al. showed that is still possible to apply Bleichenbacher's attack against real TLS servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al.</ref> showed that specific cross-tenant side channels allow for application of performant Bleichenbacher attacks in PaaS environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>In 2002, Vaudenay presented a padding oracle attack on the Cipher Block Chaining mode of operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. His idea was later used to attack further standards with improved techniques, e.g. IPSec <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, CAPTCHAs and the .NET framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, or DTLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>&lt;s o a p e n v : E n v e l o p e&gt; &lt;s o a p e n v : H e a d e r /&gt; &lt;s o a p e n v : B o d y&gt; &lt;a d d U s e r&gt;&lt;name&gt;Bob&lt;/ name&gt;&lt;/ a d d U s e r&gt; &lt;/ s o a p e n v : B o d y&gt; &lt;/ s o a p e n v : E n v e l o p e&gt; Listing 1: Exemplary SOAP message.</figDesc></figure>
