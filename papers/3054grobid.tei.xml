				<p>This paper targets the autonomic management of dynamically partially reconfigurable hardware architec-tures based on FPGAs. Discrete Control modelled with Labelled Transition Systems is employed to model the considered behaviours of the computing system and derive a controller for the control objective enforcement. We consider system application described as task graphs and FPGA as a set of reconfigurable areas that can be dynamically partially reconfigured to execute tasks. The computation of an autonomic manager is encoded as a Discrete Controller Synthesis problem w.r.t. multiple constraints and objectives e.g., mutual exclusion of resource uses, power cost minimization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Control of autonomic hardware</head><p>Controlling FPGAs. We apply the autonomic framework to the context of FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), hardware devices that compute a logic function by configuring its gates in a programmable way. A recent progress is dynamically partially reconfigurable (DPR) FPGAs. They support partial reconfigurations where only part of gates are reconfigured and reconfigurations to be performed at runtime. Autonomic computing has been seldom applied to such hardware systems, though they represent a significant case of its relevance.</p><p>Control for autonomic management. We adopt control techniques to design the MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyse, Plan, Execute, based on Knowledge). Formal models are used to describe the possible behaviours of the system under design, and control objectives giving the adaptation policy are specified separately. A controller is then derived based on the system models and objectives. The use of classical control techniques and models, typically these based on continuous time dynamics and differential equations, has been explored for various computing systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and sometimes applied for hardware architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. A similar approach can be adopted by using discrete control techniques, where systems are considered from the viewpoint of events and states. The behaviours can then be modelled in the form of Petri nets or automata for synchronisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Discrete control for autonomic FPGAs. We apply discrete control for the autonomic management of DPR FPGA based embedded systems. A systematic modelling framework is proposed, where system application behaviour, task implementations and executions, architecture reconfigurations and environment are modelled separately by using Labelled Transition Systems (LTS) or automata. Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) supported by a programming language and synthesis tool has been applied to compute an autonomic manager.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">FPGA-based architectures</head><p>Basic reconfigurable cell. A FPGA is composed of an array of logic cells and programmable routing channels to implement custom hardware functionalities. A program consists of one or more bitstreams, which are binary files storing information to configure logical cells and the routing switches. Recent large FPGAs contain more than 200K logic cells that can be combined and interconnected to implement very complex designs. Multicore architectures with tens of large hardware accelerators and processors can be implemented.</p><p>Run-time partial reconfiguration. In the new generation of FPGAs, the hardware configuration can be updated at run-time by using the partial reconfiguration feature. They have the ability to reconfigure hardware during the running of the static part, i.e., the part which does not contain any reconfigurable area. It assumes that the hardware reconfiguration does not disturb the execution of the application. The bitstreams therefore cover only some regions of the FPGA array. Such DPR FPGAs make them suitable for addressing constraints on resources (re-using some areas for different functions for applications that can be partitioned into phases) by adapting resources to available parallelism according to environment variations. DPR FPGAs are a trade-off : that they are slower than dedicated Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), but much faster than using general purpose CPUs.</p><p>Management of reconfiguration. From a technical viewpoint, each hardware configuration file used for the different implementations of the partially reconfigurable regions is stored into a compact flash card. It can be loaded by a processor (e.g. microblaze, which is a 32-bit soft-core processor as implementable on Xilinx FPGAs). It performs the reconfiguration using the ICAP (Internal Configuration Access Port) as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The runtime management of reconfiguration involves a control loop, taking decision according to events monitored on the architecture, choosing the appropriate next configuration to install, and executing appropriate reconfiguration actions. The architecture dynamism increases the design complexity, for which a complete tool-chain is lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Due to the relative novelty of DPR technologies, the management of reconfiguration has to be designed manually for important parts.</p><p>Amongst different approaches to address this issue, we investigate the adoption of an autonomic computing approach for the design of reconfiguration control. The MAPE-K structure is based on behavioural models (in the form of automata) for the knowledge about the reconfigurability of these hardware platforms, and discrete control techniques for designing the adaptation policies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Discrete control</head><p>We consider the modeling framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> based on labelled transition systems (LTSs) and their parallel composition. LTSs are defined by a finite set of states, between which there are transitions (from source state to target state) with a label of form c / a: a firing condition c and an action a. When a LTS is in some state, if there is a transition for which the condition is true, then it is taken and the next state will be its target state. At the same time the action part will take the value true. Two or more LTSs can be composed (noted formally by "|"), representing that they run in parallel: one global step corresponds to one local step for every LTS.</p><p>The formalism of LTSs can be used to apply discrete controller synthesis (DCS), a formal operation on automata <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. DCS is an automatic and constructive method to ensure required properties on system behaviors. It applies to an LTS (originally uncontrolled), where inputs I are partitioned into two subsets, I u and I c , the uncontrollable and controllable inputs. It takes into account some control objectives: properties that must be enforced by control. A controller is synthesized automatically, if it exists, from given LTS's and objectives, by applying appropriate algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (not detailed here). Its purpose is to constrain the values of controllable variables, in function of states and of uncontrollable inputs, such that system behaviors satisfy the given objectives. The controller is maximally permissive, meaning that it allows the largest possible set of correct behaviors. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(a) shows the MAPE-K architecture of an autonomic system with a loop defining basic notions of Managed Element (ME) and Autonomic Manager (AM). The managed element, system or resource is monitored through sensors. An analysis of this information is used, in combination with knowledge about the system, to plan and decide upon actions. These reconfiguration operations are executed, using as actuators the administration functions offered by the system API. Self-management issues include self-configuration, self-optimisation, selfhealing (fault tolerance and repair), and self-protection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Discrete control as MAPE-K</head><p>Autonomic managers work in closed loop: for this, one design methodology is to apply techniques from  Control Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, with the advantage of ensuring interesting properties on the resulting behaviour of the controlled system e.g., stability, convergence, reachability or avoidance of some evolutions. In most cases, continuous models are used, typically for quantitative aspects. More recently, some works relied on Discrete Event Systems (DES), using supervisory control <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, typically for logical or synchronisation purposes e.g., deadlock avoidance in multithreaded programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. They are based on reactive systems models such as Petri nets or Finite State Machines (FSM), which we also call automata. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(b), this instantiates the general autonomic loop with knowledge on possible behaviours represented as a formal state machine, and planning and execution in the form of the automaton transition function with a control output, which will trigger the actuator.</p><p>Basic features required for a system to be managed in an autonomic fashion have been identified in previous work e.g., in the context of component-based autonomic management <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>: for an ME to be manageable it must be observable and controllable. The manager transforms flows of observations into flows of control choices and actions. Observability translates into outputs, as shown by dashed arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>(c) for an FSM AM, exhibiting (some) of the knowledge and sensor information (raw, or analysed); this can feature state information on the AM itself or of MEs below. Controllability translates to having the AM accept some influence on the decision, and it corresponds to additional input for control, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> for an FSM AM. Its values can be used in the guards and exhibit choices between different transitions.</p><p>This builds up to a hierarchical framework as in the structure shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. Given that AMs have been made observable and controllable, an upper-level AM can perform their coordination using their additional control input to enforce a policy. Considering the case of FSM managers makes it possible to encode the coordination problem as a DCS problem. The controller of this upper-level AM is synthesised by DCS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">DPR FPGAs</head><p>Hardware architecture. We consider a multiprocessor architecture implemented on an FPGA chip (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1)</ref>, which includes a general purpose processor: Softcore Microblaze, and a reconfigurable area divided into four tiles: A1-A4. The communications between architecture components are achieved by a Network-onChip (NoC). Each processor and reconfigurable tile implements a NoC Interface (NI). Reconfigurable tiles can be combined and configured to implement and execute tasks by loading predefined bitstreams.</p><p>The architecture is equipped with a battery supplying the platform with energy. Regarding power management, an unused reconfigurable tile Ai can be put into sleep mode with a clock gated mechanism such that it consumes a minimum static power. Application software. We consider system functionality described as a directed, acyclic task graph (DAG). A DAG consists of a set of nodes representing the set of tasks to be executed, and a set of directed edges representing the precedence constraints between tasks. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4</ref>(a) shows an example consisting of four tasks.</p><p>In our framework, we suppose each task performs its computation with the following four control points:</p><p>• being requested or invoked;</p><p>• being delayed: requested but not yet executed;</p><p>• being executed: to be executed on the architecture;</p><p>• notifying execution finish, once it reaches its end. Occurrences of control points being requested and notifying finishes depend on runtime situations, and are thus unpredictable and uncontrollable. The way of delaying and executing tasks is taken charge by a runtime manager aiming to achieve system objectives.</p><p>Task implementation. Given a hardware architecture, a task can be implemented in various ways characterised by various parameters of interest, such as used reconfigurable tiles (ur), worst case execution time (WCET) (wt), and power peak pp. For example, two implementations of task A can be:</p><p>• A on A1: wt = 50, pp = 20;</p><p>• A on A3 + A4: wt = 10, pp = 30; In this preliminary work, we assume that WCET represents the time cost induced from the start of bitstream loading to the end of task execution. Among possible task implementations, a runtime manager is in charge of choosing the best according to system objectives.</p><p>System reconfiguration. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4(b)</ref> shows three system configuration examples. In configuration 1, task A is running on tiles A3 and A4 while tiles A and B are set to the sleep mode. Configurations 2 and 3 show two scenarios with tasks B and C running in parallel. Once task A finishes its execution according to the graph of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig- ure 4</ref>(a), the system can go to either configuration 2 or configuration 3 depending on the system requirements. For example, if the current state of the battery level is low, the system would choose configuration 2 as configuration 3 requires the complete FPGA working surface and therefore consumes more power.</p><p>System objectives. System objectives define the system functional and non-functional requirements. This section gives the objectives considered in the paper, and categorises them as logical and optimal control objectives. Generally speaking, logical objectives concern state exclusions, whereas optimal objectives target the states associated with optimal costs. Considered logical and optimal control objectives are as follows:</p><p>1. resource usage constraint: exclusive uses of reconfigurable areas A1-A4; 2. energy reduction constraint: switch areas to sleep mode when executing no task; 3. power peak constraint: power peak of hardware platform is constrained w.r.t battery levels; 4. minimise power peak of hardware platform. More system objectives can be addressed in our framework. We refer the readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">System modelling as a DCS problem</head><p>We specify the modelling of the computing system behaviour and control in terms of labelled automata. System objectives are defined based on the models. We focus on the management of computations on the reconfigurable tiles and dedicate the processor area A0 exclusively to the resulting controller.</p><p>Architecture behaviour. The architecture (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref>) includes a processor, four reconfigurable tiles {A1, A2, A3, A4} and a battery. Each tile has two execution modes, and the mode switches are controllable. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 5(a)</ref> gives the model of the behaviour of tile Ai. The mode switch action between Sleep (Sle) and Active (Act) depends on the value of the Boolean controllable variable c_a i . The output act i represents its current mode.</p><p>The battery behaviour is captured by the automaton in <ref type="figure">Figure 5(b)</ref>. It has three states labelled as follows: H (high), M (medium) and L (low). The model takes input from the battery sensor, which emits level up and down events, and keeps track of the current battery level through output st.</p><p>Application behaviour. Software application is described as a DAG, which specifies the tasks to be executed and their execution sequences and parallelism. Its execution behaviour can be captured by using an automaton with states representing the set of tasks that are active in current states. The firing conditions of transitions are task finish notifications, which could enable the executions of (some of) its immediate succeeding tasks by emitting start requests of these tasks. An algorithm to systematically construct such an scheduling automaton for a DAG can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Task execution behaviour. In consideration of the four control points of task executions (see Section 3.1), the execution behaviour of task A associated with two implementations (see Section 3.1) can be modelled as <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>(c). It features an initial idle state I A , a wait state W A , and two executing states X 1 A , X 2 A corresponding to two implementations of task A. Controllable variables are integrated in the model to encode the controllable points: being delayed and executed. Upon the receipt of start request r A , task A goes to either:</p><p>• executing state X i A , i ∈ {1, 2} if the value of controllable variable c i leading to X i A is true, or • wait state W A if delayed, i.e., the value of Boolean expression c = 񮽙 c i , i ∈ {1, 2} is false.</p><p>From wait state W A , upon the receipt of event c i , it goes to execution state X i A . When the execution of task A finishes, i.e., the end notification event e A is received, the automaton goes back to idle state I A . Output es represents its execution state.</p><p>Local execution costs. The execution costs of different task implementations are different. Three cost parameters are considered (see Section 3.1). We capture them by associating cost values denoted by a tuple (rs, wt, pp) with the states of task models, where: rs ∈ 2 RA (RA is the set of architecture resources), wt ∈ N (a WCET value) and pp ∈ N (a power peak  <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Models RM i for tile Ai, BM for battery, and T M A for the execution behavior of task A.</p><p>executing states are the values associated with their corresponding implementations. For idle and wait states, apparently rs = / 0, pp = 0. However, the wt values for idle and wait states depend on the execution times of their precedent tasks. We therefore represent it by using a special symbol ⊥, and thus we have wt ∈ N∪ ⊥.</p><p>Global system behaviour model. The parallel composition of control models for reconfigurable tiles RM 1 -RM 4 , battery BM and tasks T M A -T M D , plus scheduler Sdl comprises the system model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = RM 1 |...|RM 4 |BM|T M A |...|T M D |Sdl with initial state q 0 = (Sle 1 , ..., Sle 4 , H, I A , ..., I D , I</formula><p>). Sdl represents the automaton that captures the application behavior as discussed in Section 3.2. It represents all the possible system execution behaviours in the absence of control (i.e., a runtime manager is not yet integrated).</p><p>Global costs. A system state q is a composition of local states (denoted by q 1 , ..., q n ), and we define its global cost from the local ones as follows:</p><p>• used resources: union of used resources associated with the local states, i.e., rs(q) = 񮽙 rs(q i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n;</p><p>• power peak: the sum of values associated with the local states, i.e., pp(q) = ∑(pp(qi), 1 ≤ i ≤ n);</p><p>System objectives. The two types of system objectives: logical and optimal ones, can then be defined in terms of the states and the costs defined on the states or paths of the model. For example, Objective 1) exclusive uses of reconfigurable areas A1-A4 by tasks is defined by ∀q i , q j ∈ q, i 񮽙 = j, that rs(q i ) 񮽙 rs(q j ) = / 0. We refer the readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> for the detailed definition.</p><p>We have validated our models and manager computations experimentally by implementing a video processing system on an ML605 board from Xilinx containing an FPGA. The BZR language has been used to encode system models and objectives, and generate a correct autonomic manager in C code for the system. They are detailed elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> due to lack of space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion and Perspectives</head><p>Reconfigurable architectures, especially DPR FPGAs, constitute a platform for adaptive computing that is gaining widespread use.
