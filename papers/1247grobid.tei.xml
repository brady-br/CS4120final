				<p>Recent work on anonymizing online social networks (OSNs) has looked at privacy preserving techniques for publishing a single instance of the network. However, OSNs evolve and a single instance is inadequate for analyzing their evolution or performing longitudinal data analysis. We study the problem of repeatedly publishing OSN data as the network evolves while preserving privacy of users. Publishing multiple instances independently has privacy risks, since stitching the information together may allow an adversary to identify users. We provide methods to anonymize a dynamic network when new nodes and edges are added to the published network. These methods use link prediction algorithms to model the evolution. Using this predicted graph to perform group-based anonymization, the loss in privacy caused by new edges can be eliminated almost entirely. We propose metrics for privacy loss, and evaluate them for publishing multiple OSN instances.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>OSNs are a ubiquitous feature of modern life. A key feature of current OSNs, exemplified by Facebook, is that a user's detailed information is not visible without their explicit permission. This leaves interested partiesnetwork researchers, sociologists, app designers-to scrape away at the edges. Full release of snapshots of the network would address this need. But the default settings are private for a reason: OSNs contain sensitive personal information of their users. Principled anonymization of OSN data allows sharing with 3rd-parties without revealing private information. After simplistic anonymization methods were shown to be vulnerable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> more sophisticated anonymizations have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Prior work focused primarily on static networks: the dataset is a single instance of the network, represented as a graph, failing to capture the highly dynamic nature of social network data. We would like to repeatedly release anonymized snapshots reflecting the current state of the network. Ensuring sufficient privacy while keeping output relevant for its intended uses is more challenging in the dynamic case. Anonymizing each version of the network independently is easily shown to leak information by comparing the different versions of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Instead, we ensure that subsequent releases are consistent with the initial release. Bad decisions made for an initial anonymization mean that subsequent releases may lead to an undesirable amount of information (measured in terms of probabilities) that can be extracted about the users in the data, and may require that some information is suppressed from the subsequent releases. Without knowing how the network will grow, how do we choose proper anonymizations early on so that the information that can be extracted about individuals from later releases is minimized?</p><p>We propose a solution based on link prediction algorithms, that use the current state of the network to predict future structure. The prediction is used to choose an anonymization which is expected to remain safe and useful for future releases. Existing prediction methods tend to over-predict edges, i.e., they suggest many more edges than actually arrive. Thus, we cannot treat the predicted edges equally to observed edges, and must define how to integrate predicted edges with anonymization algorithms. We present a variety of methods to select a subset of predicted edges to find a usable anonymization.</p><p>Outline and Contributions. Section 2 defines the anonymization problem for dynamic graphs, and describes four requirements of the output. Section 3 provides metrics for evaluating privacy preservation of anonymizations based on prediction. Section 4 discusses how different prediction models can be incorporated into our framework, and how the results of the prediction can be fine-tuned by adoption of conditions for anonymization. Section 5 presents experiments over temporal data representing social network activity from three different sources, and empirically evaluates privacy guarantees and utility resulting from our anonymization methods. Our study shows that with the correct choice of prediction method and anonymization properties, it is possible to provide useful data on dynamic social networks while retaining sufficient privacy. We conclude in Section 6 after reviewing related work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Problem Definition</head><p>Graph Model. A time-varying social network can be represented with a graph G t = (V t , E t ). Here V t is the set of vertices that represent users (or, entities) U t that are a part of the network at time t, and E t is the set of all edges (interactions between users) created up to time t. Each user is associated with a set of attributes. Let G = {G 1 , G 2 , . . . , G T } be the sequence of T graphs representing the network observed at timesteps t = 1, 2, . . . , T respectively. We assume edges and nodes are only added to the graph, not deleted (our model can be extended to allow deletions, but we do not discuss this issue in this presentation) Thus, we have V t ⊆ V t+1 and E t ⊆ E t+1 , i.e. the graph at time t represents the complete history of events recorded on the graph. New edges created between time t and t + 1 form the set E t+1 \E t . Accordingly, any edge created at time t + 1 is one of three kinds (i) "old-old": between nodes v, w ∈ V t (ii) "old-new": between node v ∈ V t and w ∈ V t+1 \V t (iii) "new-new": between nodes v, w ∈ V t+1 \V t . Let T be the current timestamp so that all prior graphs G i for i ≤ T are observed and known. The graph continues to evolve so that the graph G T +i for i &gt; 0 represents the (unknown) future state of the network.</p><p>Problem Statement. Given G as input, our objective at any time T is to publish an anonymized version of graph G t as G t . The output graph G t should have the following properties based on privacy parameters p n and p e : 1. entity privacy: any u ∈ U t cannot be identified with a node in G t with probability &gt; p n . 2. privacy of observed edges: for any two entities u 1 , u 2 ∈ U t , where t ≤ T , without background information it should not be possible to determine the existence of an edge between them with probability &gt; p e . 3. privacy of future edges: when G T +i is later published, it should not be possible to identify the presence of an edge between u 1 , u 2 ∈ U T +i with probability &gt; p e . 4. utility: the anonymized graphs should be usable to obtain accurate answers to queries involving longitudinal analysis (e.g., how does the interaction between users from NJ change between two releases G t and G t+1 ). Prior work in graph anonymization focused on publishing a single graph instance, with requirements similar to goals 1 and 2 above. When publishing information about network evolution, new events impact what has already been published, which motivates the third goal. If the anonymization has any value (i.e. it meets the fourth </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Anonymizing a single graph</head><p>The (full) list-based scheme for anonymizing a single graph was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> (Section 6 identifies other methods). It masks the mapping between nodes in the graph V and entities U such that each v ∈ V is associated with a list of possible labels l(v) ⊂ U . The original label of a node must appear within that node's list. Using the full list anonymization scheme, |l(v)| ≥ k and |l(v)| nodes are assigned the same label list. The underlying graph structure is published, with a label list at each node instead of the user identifier. The lists can be generated by partitioning the nodes into groups of size k, so that each node in the group is given the same list, which consists of all (true) labels of nodes in the group.</p><p>If the links between nodes in a group, or between nodes in two groups, are dense, then an observer will conclude a high probability of certain edges. This contradicts the "privacy of observed edges" requirement, even while the privacy of entities requirement may be met. Hence, lists are generated by dividing nodes into g groups S 1 , S 2 . . . S g so that they satisfy a Safety Condition. This condition states (informally) that each node must interact with at most one node in any group and so ensures sparsity of interactions between nodes of any two groups. The resulting grouping guarantees the privacy of entities with parameter p n = 1/k, and the privacy of observed edges with p e = 1/k. Our focus in this paper is on maintaining this safety condition in the presence of arriving nodes and edges. For more context, and details of the strength it provides, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Example 1. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(a)</ref> shows a sample snapshot of a graph at time t with node-set V t = {1, 2, . . . 10}. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1(b)</ref>, the graph has been anonymized using the full list method: the nodes are partitioned into groups with k = 2 as A = {1, 8}, B = {2, 9}, C = {3, 10}, D = {4, 6}, and E = {5, 7}. The anonymized version satisfies the safety condition and shows the same graph with each node label replaced by the name of its group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Na¨ıveNa¨ıve Approach to Dynamic Privacy</head><p>A natural first approach to anonymizing an evolving network G = {G 1 , G 2 , . . . , G T } is to individually anonymize each G t ∈ G and publish each corresponding anonymized graph G t in turn as it is produced. For timestep t, G t is grouped and each node v ∈ V t is assigned a list l t (v). However, since we treat each G t separately, v's list is potentially different at different times t. Publishing the resulting set of lists is likely to reveal the identity of v. For instance, let the lists assigned to v at two timesteps be l 1 (v) = {u 1 , u 2 , u 3 } and l 2 (v) = {u 1 , u 4 , u 5 }. The identity of v must be u 1 , violating entity privacy. This style of attack is possible because the partitioning of the nodes into groups varies across different releases of data, which allows linking attacks across the releases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. A natural fix keeps the partitioning consistent over timesteps; i.e., partitioning of the vertices present in previous steps are kept the same. New vertices are grouped together, and the resulting grouping published using the lists implied. This approach (the "na¨ıvena¨ıve method"), clearly has the same guarantees on nodeprivacy. We can modify existing algorithms to build groupings that respect the safety conditions for new-new edges and the new-old edges (as defined above). But if we fix the grouping, new edges between existing nodes that arrive at time t (i.e. the old-old edges) may violate the safety condition, and thus break the privacy guarantees. If too many edges arrive between a pair of existing groups, the (future) edge privacy is broken, as these edges can be identified with higher probability. We can then either publish these edges, with an associated elevated probability of revelation, or suppress them, which distorts the published graph and alters its basic properties. Our goal is to minimize the impact of these future edges compared to the na¨ıvena¨ıve method, without knowing where they will arise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Privacy Metrics</head><p>We partition the nodes into groups to minimize loss of edge privacy. As we must commit to a grouping before new edges arise, subsequent edges could raise the probability of re-identifying an edge. The first metric to quantify the effect of adding new edges on privacy is Edge Identification which measures the likelihood of identifying an interaction. Definition 1. Given a pair of groups of nodes at time t, S 1 ⊂ V t and S 2 ⊂ V t , their Edge Identification</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">EI(S 1 , S 2 )</formula><p>is the ratio of the number of edges between the two groups to the maximum number of such edges:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">EI(S 1 , S 2 ) = |(S 1 × S 2 ) ∩ E t | |S 1 | · |S 2 | Applying it to a grouping of G t counts the pairs of groups S 1 , S 2 with EI(S 1 , S 2 ) ≥ α, for 1/k 2 ≤ α ≤ 1.</formula><p>Note that EI is the probability an attacker can attach to a particular pair of users in groups S 1 , S 2 : over all the possibilities encoded by the grouping, only an EI(S 1 , S 2 ) fraction connect any pair of users with an edge. When the grouping satisfies the safety condition, EI(S 1 , S 2 ) is at most 1/k for any pair S 1 , S 2 , since each of the k nodes in a group may be connected to one node in the other group. Even when the safety condition is violated, this metric may still be less than 1/k. Consider a node v 1 ∈ S 1 that interacts with nodes w 1 , w 2 ∈ S 2 , and these are the only links between the two groups. Here, the grouping does not meet the safety condition, but EI(S 1 , S 2 ) = 2/|S 1 ||S 2 |, which is no more than than 1/k. Conversely though, if the number of interactions between a pair of groups of size k is more than k, it is not possible to meet the safety condition: some node in one group must connect to more than one node in the other. At the same time, the EI value must be greater than 1/k. Hence, we can think of the safety condition as guaranteeing an EI of at most 1/k, but not vice-versa. For full list anonymization to provide guarantees on the privacy of edges (observed or future), any pair of groups</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S 1 , S 2 , must have EI(S 1 , S 2 ) ≤ p e .</formula><p>The second privacy metric concerns the density of interactions between a given node and other groups.</p><p>Definition 2. For a node v ∈ V t , the Node-Group Density with respect to a given group S is defined as N G(v, S) = |w ∈ S : (v, w) ∈ E|/|S|. The overall Node-Group density of node v is defined as the maximum node group density of v over all groups i.e., N G(v) = max S (N G(v, S)) . Applying the metric to a grouping of a graph counts the number of nodes v with</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N G(v) ≥ β, for 1/k ≤ β ≤ 1.</formula><p>The condition N G(v) &gt; 1/k for any node v is a witness for a safety condition violation. A single violation has only limited local implications for edge privacy. Measuring the node-group density this way quantifies the extent to which the grouping is at risk. Even if N G(v) = 1, the maximum possible value, privacy of the node's interactions is not lost. But, if v is re-identified, then so are at least k interactions of v. Our goal is to anonymize each G t so that EI and N G are small as new nodes and edges are added.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Dynamic Graph Anonymization</head><p>Our approach chooses a grouping of the nodes in V 1 and publishes G 1 using this grouping. That is, we publish the full graph structure along with a list of entities and their attributes, at each node. This is useful for answering a variety of queries on subpopulations within the network. We publish subsequent graphs by extending the grouping to the new nodes, i.e. V 2 \V 1 , V 3 \V 2 and so on. We measure the quality of our initial choices by tracking the two privacy metrics for the published graphs as new edges arrive, i.e. E 2 \E 1 , E 3 \E 2 etc. Our techniques to choose the initial grouping are based on predicting which new edges are most likely, via link prediction. Link prediction has been heavily studied in the link analysis and mining literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. We want to predict which links are likely to arise with the new nodes in V t \V t−1 and hence choose how to group these new nodes so existing edges meet a safety condition, and future edges are unlikely to violate it. If the model predicts most future edges, the number of links between nodes in any pair of groups will remain small, and privacy guarantees should remain intact (future edge privacy).</p><p>More precisely, at time t we use link prediction model M to predict˜Gpredict˜ predict˜G t = (V t , E t ∪ ˜ E t ), which includes a set of predicted edges, ˜ E t . We use˜Guse˜ use˜G t to generate the groups for V t \V t−1 , (nodes which have not yet been assigned to groups). In doing so, the grouping respects the safety condition for the combination of the previously observed edges (E t ) and additionally uses information about the predicted edges ( ˜ E t ) to further guide the grouping process. For now, we assume M is given, and focus on using it for anonymization. We do not predict the arrival of new nodes from outside V t : these can be grouped when they do arrive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Grouping Conditions</head><p>The formal safety condition for a static graph in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∀v 1 ∈ S 1 , w 1 , w 2 ∈ S 2 , (v 1 , w 1 ), (v 1 , w 2 ) ∈ E ⇒ w 1 = w 2 .</formula><p>This ensures sparsity of interaction between nodes in any pair of groups, and also holds recursively if groups are partitioned. A natural approach to extend this tõ G t would be to apply the above condition with E replaced by E t ∪ ˜ E t . However, prediction models tend to predict a very large number of edges. So there may be no safe grouping that satisfies the additional constraints introduced by these edges. Instead, we propose a subtly different condition.</p><p>Definition 3. A grouping of nodes in graph˜Ggraph˜ graph˜G t , satisfies the Prediction-based Condition if</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∀v 1 ∈ S 1 , w 1 , w 2 ∈ S 2 : (v 1 , w 1 ) ∈ E t ∧ (v 1 , w 2 ) ∈ (E t ∪ ˜ E t ) ⇒ w 1 = w 2 i.</formula><p>e. there is no path of length two between two nodes in a group with at most one predicted edge in the path.</p><p>Example 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1(a)</ref> shows existing edges as solid lines and predicted edges as dotted lines. The safety condition (without prediction) allows nodes 1 and 10 to be in the same group, but the prediction-based condition does not. Under prediction grouping 4 and 10 can be in the same group, as all 2 hop paths have two predicted edges.</p><p>The prediction-based condition is stronger than the previous safety condition: the set of groupings satisfying the prediction condition is a subset of those satisfying safety. Next, we propose an alternate, more liberal density based condition which restricts the number of interactions between pairs of groups instead of at the node-level.</p><p>Definition 4. A grouping satisfies the Group Density condition if, for every pair of groups (S 1 , S 2 ), the density of links from E t ∪ ˜ E t between nodes in S 1 and nodes in S 2 is less than η, with 0 ≤ η ≤ 1. This is achieved by insisting that EI(S 1 , S 2 ) is bounded by η.</p><p>A grouping that violates the prediction-based condition may still be allowed by the group density condition. Here, EI is upper bounded by η, which can be smaller than the 1/k of the prediction-based condition. So enforcing a tighter group density condition may allow more edges to be added between a pair of groups before EI exceeds 1/k.</p><p>A natural greedy heuristic finds a grouping which respects a given condition. The algorithm takes each new node v ∈ (V t \V t−1 ) in turn, and inserts v into the first group of size less than k created at time t, so that the newly formed group satisfies the grouping condition (either the prediction-based or group density condition). If no such group can be found, then a new group of size k is created, initially containing v alone, which by definition satisfies either grouping condition. At the end of the procedure, any nodes in groups of size less than k can be merged into other groups (created at t) to form a few groups of size k + 1. When using anonymized graphs, it is often preferable to have entities with similar attributes grouped together, provided the conditions are still met. This is achieved, for instance, by considering the nodes in an order which respects this clustering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Modeling graph evolution</head><p>It is important to distinguish between the class of generative models, which create a synthetic instance with the aim to match the observed properties of real networks; and predictive models which take an existing instance of a network and predict which links are likely to occur in future. Here, we summarize the most relevant predictive models (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for more background). In our setting, there is less concern over false-positives given by a linkprediction algorithm: the privacy provided is the same even if it turns out not to exist. Hence, we can adopt models which predict more edges than actually arrive.</p><p>Friend-of-a-friend (FOAF). For a given node, the FOAF model predicts edges to all nodes that are within two hops in G t . Formally this model predicts edges˜Eedges˜ edges˜E t as, ∀u, v, z ∈ V t : (u, v), (v, z) ∈ E t ⇒ (u, z) ∈ ˜ E t . The model treats each such edge equally likely to appear. Common Neighbors (CN). The CN model assumes that when there are many common neighbors of two nodes they are more likely to become linked. It predicts the same links as FOAF, but attaches higher weight to those with more common neighbors. More precisely, it gives weights˜Wweights˜ weights˜W t as, ˜ W t (u, z) = |v ∈ V t : (u, v), (v, z) ∈ E t |. These weights are mostly small, typically 1 or 2. Adamic-Adar (AA). The AA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> extends the previous models by arguing that all neighbors are not equal: a common neighbor with a low degree is more significant than one with a very high degree. The weight on an edge between u and z is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">˜ W t (u, z) = v∈Vt:(u,v),(v,z)∈Et 1 log(deg(v))</formula><p>This predicts the same set of edges as FOAF and CN, but applies a finer gradation of weights. Preferential Attachment (PA). The PA model is based on global properties of the graph. It assumes that links are more likely to nodes with high degree than to nodes with low degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. For any two nodes u, z ∈ V t the model predicts an edge between them with weight˜W weight˜ weight˜W t (u, z) = deg(u) · deg(z), where deg(u) is the degree of node u. PA implicitly predicts all possible edges, so thresholding is needed to make this meaningful.</p><p>Exactly which model is most suitable depends also on features of the social network itself. For instance, Facebook suggests friends drawn from the user's local structure, which tends to lead to a denser local graph (i.e. adding FOAF links). By contrast, networks such as Flickr and Twitter allow directed links that don't have to be reciprocated, and so promote popular users (i.e. a more PA-style growth model).</p><p>Several other features of nodes affect link creation, including, homophily (similarity of node attributes) and temporal state of a node to capture whether it is actively adding links or has reached a stable phase. These insights can be incorporated into the adopted model to adjust weights on predicted edges accordingly. Our anonymization approach is not strongly model dependent, so if new models are proposed to modify weights, they can naturally be incorporated into our framework. Clearly though, the resulting privacy and utility will depend on how well the predictions match reality. In our experimental evaluation we compare the relatively simple PA, FOAF, CN and AA models, and show that they are sufficient to show clear gains over no prediction.  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: FriendFeed data at 6 timestamps effectively predicts an edge between all pairs of nodes. Finding a grouping that meets a condition (which enforces local sparsity) can be impossible on a dense graph, so it is imperative to select a subset of the predicted edges. We propose several alternatives:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Choosing from Predicted Links</head><p>Global Threshold (GT): pick the top τ most heavily weighted edges. This might predict many more edges incident on some nodes than others. In the PA model, almost all predicted edges will be incident on the highest degree nodes.</p><p>Local Threshold (LT): pick the τ edges at each node which have the highest weight. This implicitly assumes a uniform level of activity across nodes, whereas in reality activity varies over the network.</p><p>Adaptive-Local Threshold (ALT): pick the top f (deg(v)) edges, where f (deg(v)) is a function of the the current degree deg(v) of node v. f can be e.g., linear or logarithmic in deg(v); it can also be set based on observed historic behavior of node growth.</p></div>

If all predicted edges are included in the output of the model, the graph is no longer sparse enough to find a grouping satisfying the grouping conditions. We use thresholding to choose a subset of the predicted links based on their weights. A predicted edge is considered a "true positive" if it is observed in the graph at time T . We compare the threshold methods by computing the fraction of true positives chosen by each method for a fixed number of chosen edges, τ . We aim to choose a large τ value, provided that a grouping can be computed that respects the predictionbased condition. For Facebook data with AA, we fix τ = 10M, to allow sufficient over-prediction while still being able to group the graph. GT chooses 79% of the true positives. For LT, since there are 54K nodes, we pick the top τ = 10M/54K= 185 predicted edges by weight, for each node. This chooses 81% of the true positives. The threshold function for the ALT is chosen by first dividing the nodes into b bins (b = 10), based on their degree at t = 0. We set a local threshold by taking the distribution of final degrees of all nodes in each bin, and set the threshold f (deg(v)) to be the 95th percentile of these. The parameter b and the percentile chosen may be tuned for each dataset based on node degree distribution. Of the thresholding methods, ALT best captures the true positives and picks 98% of them. For Facebook, all three threshold schemes work reasonably well. However, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the number of edges added by nodes is not constant. Fixing one threshold for all nodes does not work as well as ALT. Since ALT outperforms the other methods for all datasets, we adopt this as the method of choice for all subsequent analysis. We show the percentage of true positives chosen using ALT in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>Partitioning Nodes into Groups. Depending on the sparsity G t , there may be no grouping for a given k. For instance, if two nodes with high degrees are connected, then predicting all FOAF links means that no pair of their neighbors can be placed in the same group. This was the case in FriendFeed, where "celebrities" rendered it ungroupable for k = 10 even with the na¨ıvena¨ıve grouping. Ta-    shows the groupability of all datasets. In the rest of the section, we use k = 10 unless specified. For grouping FriendFeed, we ignore the 12 nodes with degree above 5000 to make the graph groupable with the nai¨venai¨ve grouping. The graph is ungroupable using FOAF, but by modifying ALT to predict no links for the top 209 high degree nodes (degree &gt; 1000), the graph becomes groupable with the prediction-based grouping condition. Celebrity nodes in Flickr are handled similarly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Evaluating Privacy</head><p>We evaluate the privacy metrics EI and N G (Section 3.3). We anonymize the graph at t = 0 using no prediction, G t , and˜Gand˜ and˜G t using FOAF, CN or AA models. We compute the EI and N G counts for each anonymized graph at t = T . For each dataset, we compare the difference in EI (and N G) values for G t , and˜Gand˜ and˜G t . In our experiments, out of the pairs of groups that interact, over 85% have at most one interaction between them, that is, α = 1/k 2 for such pairs. This case is interesting as the EI values for α = 1/k 2 are larger when using prediction, signifying that new edges are added between pairs of nodes that did not already interact. For α ≥ 2/k 2 the EI values are smaller for prediction-based grouping than the na¨ıvena¨ıve grouping. This reduction signifies that fewer groups have more than 2 edges between them. Both cases are desirable for maintaining sparsity in interactions between groups, which translates to improved privacy for a grouping-based anonymization.</p><p>Edge Identification. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> shows the percentage change in EI when using prediction as compared with no prediction for different settings. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 3(a)</ref>, 3(b) and 3(c) show the improvement in EI for Facebook, FriendFeed and Flickr respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3(a)</ref> shows an improvement of about 90% in EI for publishing˜Gpublishing˜ publishing˜G t using FOAF over publishing˜Gpublishing˜ publishing˜G t without prediction. The gain in using the fewer predicted edges from AA or CN is still significant: over 50% for α = 0.04 and above. High values of α correspond to more edges between a pair of groups. The larger gain for higher values of α is expected, since use of predicted edges prevents groupings that have many edges between them. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3(b)</ref> shows a similar trend with an average improvement of 93% over different α for the FriendFeed dataset anonymized using FOAF. For this dataset, the CN model (average gain 90%) seems to better explain the formation of the new links as compared with AA (average gain 43%), due to the greater number of true positives chosen. We observe that AA chooses 46% of correctly predicted links, while CN chooses about 70% of the true positives. The FOAF model for Flickr shows about a 36% improvement over the na¨ıvena¨ıve grouping as seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> Group Size. Next we study the privacy parameter k, and its effect on EI. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3(d)</ref> shows the results on Facebook dataset for k = 5, 10 and 15 using FOAF. For k = 5, there are more groups than with larger values of k. Hence, the likelihood of a new edge being added to a given pair of groups is smaller resulting in a smaller EI, and a relatively small benefit in using prediction. Conversely, for large k, the improvement in EI from predicting links and grouping accordingly is greater.</p><p>Multiple Releases. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>(e) shows the absolute values of EI for multiple releases of the FriendFeed network. For a given α, the absolute EI values of na¨ıvena¨ıve approach are significantly higher than with using prediction. The EI values increase before Feb, when many links are added to the graph. Before that, no pairs of groups have 4 or more links with prediction-based grouping. With fewer links added between existing nodes after Feb, the EI values change little.</p><p>Node-Group Density. The prediction based anonymization shows significant improvement over the na¨ıvena¨ıve anonymization for the Node-Group Density metric as well. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3(f)</ref> shows the improvement in the N G metric for graph˜Ggraph˜ graph˜G t over G t . We present results for β = 0.2 and k = 10, which is equivalent to computing the number of pairs of groups where the safety condition is violated. That is, there exists at least one node in the groups that connects with two or more nodes in any other group. As with EI, the trend is that FOAF performs best, then CN followed by AA.</p><p>Group Density Condition. This condition was proposed to allow grouping a graph that is "ungroupable" using stricter safety and prediction-based conditions. Here, we consider all links including those that involve the high degree nodes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4(a)</ref> shows the improvement in EI obtained using FOAF and AA with group density condition on FriendFeed. This dataset is groupable using the group density condition, but not the prediction-based condition. Prediction results in a significant improvement in EI for various η, or density of links between groups. The results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>(a) are for a grouping that allows at most η = 4/k 2 . The small improvement in EI for large α with AA is due to the small number of pairs of groups (S 1 , S 2 ) that have EI(S 1 , S 2 ) = α. For the plot shown, the difference in the number of pairs of groups betweeñ G t and G t for α ≤ 0.09 is in thousands, while that for α &gt; 0.09 is less than 5. under the safety condition and the more relaxed group density condition for anonymization without prediction. We use Facebook, as it is groupable for both conditions so we can directly compare the privacy provided. For a given α ≥ 0.02, the number of groups with EI ≥ α is much larger for the group density condition, leading to weaker privacy. With the safety condition there are no groups with more than 9 edges between them, which is not the case with the group density condition. Thus, the group density condition allows us to group graphs that are ungroupable under the safety condition, but with lower privacy bounds.</p><p>Utility. We analyze the accuracy of results of querying multiple releases of an anonymized graph. We compute the relative error in the query result with respect to the true result obtained on querying the unanonymized graph. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4(c)</ref> shows the relative error for the query: "How many Facebook users aged 15-20 interact with users aged 20-30 at the start and end of the measurement period?" Our results show that there is negligible loss of utility when using AA compared to na¨ıvena¨ıve grouping. The result is slightly better on graphs grouped using the AA and CN compared to FOAF. Similar trends were observed for a workload of 20 other queries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Graph Anonymization. There has been much research on data anonymization since k-anonymity on tabular data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and efforts in statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. There are two styles of approach to the graph anonymization problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Graph modification adds and removes links so that the same structure appears multiple times in the graph. This is intended to defeat attacks which try to link to known structure in the graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The duplicated structure can be local, such as degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> or immediate neighborhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, or global, such as full reachability from each node <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, a graph may need a lot of modification before it meets these requirements.</p><p>Clustering-based methods aggregate edge or node information, so that there are many possible mappings from the clustering back to graphs, of which the original graph is promised to be one. List anonymization (Section 3) falls in this space; other variations are found in the work of <ref type="bibr">Campan et al. [5]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Zheleva et al. [18]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Zou et al. [21]</ref> discuss the case of dynamic social network data (as an extension of their graph modification method), arguing that it can handle multiple releases by simply adding more dummy edges to mirror the newly arriving edges in k places around the graph. Use of prediction to better prepare for those edges that are likely to arrive is not discussed.</p><p>Evolution of Social Networks. An early large scale study on the evolution of two social networks Flickr and Yahoo! 360 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> proposed a generative model based on preferential attachment biased by the activity state of the node. Empirical studies on Flickr <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and FriendFeed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> analyze the growth of these networks over time. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, the authors showed that 80% of new links in Flickr are between nodes that are two-hops away.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Concluding Remarks</head><p>Our methods for anonymization of social network data permit multiple releases of data. The published data meets privacy requirements while remaining useful for further analysis. Link prediction gives significant benefits in maintaining the privacy in the data. It remains to extend this approach to other techniques for graph anonymization, such as other clustering and modification based methods. The clustering methods we studied give anonymity guarantees against adversaries with a limited background knowledge. However, it is also desirable to defend against more powerful adversaries, such as those that control large numbers of entities and manipulate their link structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Anonymization of a single snapshot of a graph</figDesc></figure>
