				<p>Byte-addressable non-volatile memory (BNVM) technologies are closing the performance gap between traditional storage and memory. However, the integrity of persistent data structures after an unclean shutdown remains a major concern. Logging and shadow paging are commonly used to ensure consistency of BNVM systems. But both approaches can impose significant performance and energy overhead by writing extra data into BNVM. Our approach leverages the indirection of virtual memory to avoid the need for logging actual data and uses a novel cache line-level mapping mechanism to eliminate the need to write unnecessary data. Thus, our approach is able to significantly reduce the overhead of committing data to BNVM. Our preliminary evaluation results show that using OSP for transactions reduces the overhead necessary to persist data by up to 1.96× as compared to undo-log. Moreover, our approach can be used to provide fast, low-overhead persistence for hardware transactional memory, further facilitating the acceptance of BNVM into computing systems.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Byte-addressable Non-Volatile Memory (BNVM) is becoming a reality, as technologies such as STT-RAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>, PCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> (Phase-Change Memory) and memristor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> show DRAM-like performance and disk-like persistence. Building applications directly upon BNVM can be simpler, since code that serializes and deserializes inmemory data structures to and from persistent storage is no longer needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and more efficient, since overhead from legacy system software layers such as file systems and the block layer may be avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref>. However, applications need a mechanism to safely update their persistent data structures so they can recover from an inconsistent state after an unclean shutdown such as a crash.</p><p>Logging is commonly used to ensure storage consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref>. However, when logging is used, old data (or new data) need to be copied to somewhere else (a logging area in BNVM) before the data can be updated in-place. However, using CPU instructions such as clwb, movnti, and mfence to persist the copied data greatly harms performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>. To combat this problem, we observed that shadow paging can eliminate data copying by taking advantage of virtual memory indirection. Shadow paging is different from logging in that it has no distinct log area and data area. It keeps the old data inplace, writes the new data to any other free physical page, and atomically updates the persistent virtual-to-physical mappings when a transaction completes.</p><p>One challenge of using shadow paging, however, is the amplified overhead caused by the gap between the large page size (typically 4-8 KB) and the number of bytes that are actually modified, which could be as small as few bytes. Simply reducing the page size would result in an unacceptable increase in virtual-to-physical mapping and page table walk overhead <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>.</p><p>To address this issue, we propose Optimized Shadow Paging (OSP), which offers the same transactional semantics as shadow paging with fine-grained persistence at the level of a cache line. The key idea of OSP is to employ compact cache line level mappings within each valid page. OSP requires only two bits per cache line to construct these mappings, and only requires them for pages whose entries are currently in the TLB, since those are the only pages actively being accessed. As <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows, when OSP is used to perform transactional updates, each virtual page is associated with two physical pages, P0 and P1, enabling the system to maintain two physical versions of each virtual cache line. This, in turn, allows the system to preserve the previously-consistent state of a virtual page as it presents the current state of  this virtual page to memory accesses. To build practical durable transactions, we use lightweight journaling or super pages to provide atomicity for multi-page transactions, and we integrate page consolidation with TLB eviction for space efficiency. Our proposed design can be easily supported by hardware and only requires minimal OS changes. A hardware implementation improve performances by avoiding the extra instructions required by software <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> compares two existing techniques, undologging and shadow paging, against OSP. It demonstrates that OSP transactions offer two advantages. First, OSP does not require data copying in the critical path, avoiding the performance overhead that results from it. Second, BNVM technologies often have limited write endurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, and OSP significantly reduces the number of writes to BNVM, thus mitigating this issue. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows the high-level components that are used to build durable OSP transactions: an extended TLB, a  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Overview of OSP transactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Design</head><p>consistent state table, and a lightweight journal. Cache line level mappings of OSP are implemented as two sets of bitmaps, a committed bitmap and an updated bitmap. These bitmaps are combined in different ways to determine which cache lines make up the current state of a virtual page, and which cache lines make up the most recent consistent state of the page. Each TLB entry must be extended to contain both bitmaps for each page in the TLB, but the bitmaps need not be in the page table. Instead, the consistent states (committed bitmap) are also stored in a persistent table. These durable consistent states allow applications to recover after an unclean shutdown. Transaction commit advances the durable consistent state. When multiple virtual pages are updated in a transaction, their combined durable consistent state must be updated atomically: either all pages move to their next consistent states or none do. We propose two approaches to provide such atomicity: lightweight journalling, which only tracks whose consistent states (e.g., virtual page numbers) need to be changed and how (e.g., updated bitmap); and super page, which recursively combines multi-page transactions into a single-page transaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Cache line Level Mappings</head><p>The two per-page bitmaps, with one entry for each cache line in the page, allow OSP to track modifications to individual cache lines and to determine which cache line is "current" and which represents state from the last transaction. Each cache line's state is represented by a single committed bit and a single updated bit, which is analogous to the dirty bit in a regular cache. The committed bit for a cache line "points" to the page containing the cache line as it appeared at the most recent commit. The updated bit is set to one whenever the cache line is written, and is reset as part of the commit process. Since each bit refers to the cache line at the same offset in both P0 and P1, it is sufficient for the TLB entry to simply contain the physical page number for each of P0 and P1; the offset is determined as usual from the address. As a transaction is being processed, reads are directed to the page determined by XORing the committed bit and the updated bit. If the cache line is clean, reads go to the most recently committed version. If the cache line has been modified in the transaction, the updated bit is set and the read goes to the "other" cache line. Writes always go to the page determined by committed bit ⊕ 1, and the updated bit is set as part of the write operation.</p><p>Because these operations are very simple and require few gate delays, adding support for OSP is unlikely to significantly affect the critical path for TLB translation. TLB translations and cache accesses are done in parallel in commonly-used virtually-indexed physically-tagged caches, which could further hide the increase, if any, in TLB translation latency. One potential issue, however, arises with virtually-addressed caches, since this approach does cache access before TLB access completes. Moreover, virtually-addressed caches have no support for including two versions of a single cache line, beyond the use of a process-specific identifier. While our approach works well with physically-addressed caches, we are currently exploring options to support virtually addressed caches.</p><p>Under OSP, TLB entries must be made wider to store information about the current states of virtual pages. A TLB entry now includes two PPNs, a committed bitmap, and a updated bitmap. This enables the memory management unit to quickly access the values as part of TLB access, and to determine which of the physical pages associated with a single virtual address should be used for the memory access. Although OSP might double the size of the TLB entries (assuming 64-bit bitmaps), we think such overhead is acceptable. Alternatively, we can use a separate hardware unit to store the OSP-related information, so normal TLB entries would be immune to such storage overhead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Page Consolidation</head><p>It's a waste of precious memory space to associate these virtual pages that are not actively being updated with two physical pages. Thus, when a virtual page is evicted from the last TLB (not being actively accessed), we consolidate valid data to one physical page and free the other one. The consolidation overhead is minimized by merging the page that has fewer valid cache lines into the other one. Note that we currently couple page consolidation with TLB eviction for simplicity, but page consolidation could be done lazily. Finally, we update the virtual-tophysical mapping table so that the virtual page refers to the physical page with all the valid data. As an optimization, page consolidation could be moved out of the critical path in a TLB fault, since it need not be performed immediately on a TLB fault. We plan to investigate hardware/OS support for asynchronous page consolidation in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">OSP Semantics</head><p>Regular Memory Accesses. Because we envision future systems will have a hybrid of DRAM and BNVM, we distinguish two types of stores. Transactional stores (e.g., stores to persistent memory) require a crash consistency guarantee while regular ones (e.g., stores to volatile memory) don't. Regular memory accesses begin with address translation. As discussed in Section 2.1, the TLB function is changed in order to always present current states to a running thread. Given a virtual address (assume hit), depending on the corresponding bits (XOR them) for the accessed cache line in committed bitmap and updated bitmap, either P0 or P1 is returned to the processor. The remainder of the path for memory accesses is unaffected. Transactional Stores. Transactional stores involve three steps. First, we must copy the cache line from its old location to its new location if this is the first time that the cache line has been updated in the transaction. This step can be completed in hardware by simply updating the cache tag to reflect the "current" page of the cache line after we read this cache line from its old location. Second, we update the TLB to indicate that the cache line gets updated. This can be done unconditionally, since it's easier to always set the updated bit in the TLB than it is to first determine whether it has already been set. After this is done, a transactional write proceeds as a regular write access, using the new value of the updated bit (set) to determine which page to write. Commit. When the current state of a virtual page reaches a consistent state, the commit operation provided by OSP is used to bring the consistent state of the virtual page update-to-date by XORing the updated bitmap into the committed bitmap and clearing the updated bitmap. Abort. If a transaction must be aborted, this can easily be done by simply clearing the updated bitmap, restoring the page's state to the most recent (successful) commit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Making OSP Transactions Durable</head><p>OSP allows us to always keep a consistent state of a virtual page while serving transactional updates, but we must still ensure that transactions become durable. While our techniques work well with a single page, we must also allow multiple pages to be updated in a failureatomic way. Make Consistent States Recoverable. The OS maintains a consistent state table of tuples of the form V, P0, P1, CB, which associates a virtual page V with two physical pages (P0 and P1) as well as a committed bitmap CB, in BNVM. The OS only updates the consistent state table on TLB misses (we assume softwaremanaged TLB is supported). A new tuple is added if there is no tuple with the same V already in the set, and a tuple is removed when it gets evicted from the last processor TLB. Make Transaction Commit Durable. Durable transactions guarantee data persistence after commit requests are acknowledged. The first step towards this goal is to find the cache lines that have been updated by the transaction and force them to be written back to NVM. We are able to track the updated cache lines via the updated bitmap in the extended TLB. Then, for new consistent states to be retrievable even after power cycling, we atomically update the corresponding committed bitmaps stored in the consistent state </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Performance Implications</head><p>OSP can provide durable transactions with almost no cost for workloads with decent locality. The performance overhead of OSP mainly comes from journaling and page consolidation. Our journaling only requires one small record per updated virtual page. In comparison, logging might require one record with actual data per update. Page consolidation overhead is not a pertransaction overhead. We only need to pay for it for space efficiency when a virtual page is not being actively updated. Journaling overhead depends on the spatial locality of the workloads while page consolidation overhead depends on the temporal locality of the workloads. OSP can benefit from workloads with either of these localities. Moreover, unlike redo-log, OSP has almost no overhead of address remapping, since it doesn't need to keep the updates in a separate log area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Evaluation</head><p>We evaluated OSP by comparing it, under simulation, with an undo-logging approach. Our experiments show that OSP is much more efficient than undo-logging, and allow us to measure the components of overhead in OSP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental Setup</head><p>Simulator.</p><p>We are implementing our design in McSimA+ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a Pin-based cycle-accurate simulator. We configure the simulator to model a system with out-oforder processors, 64-entry L1 DTLB, etc. Our prototype has not been fully implemented yet, so we can not provide overall performance measurement at this point. However, we are able to collect some performancecritical information such as CPU flushes. Note that we use CPU flushes to represent cache flushes (e.g., data) as well as write-combining buffer flushes (e.g., uncacheable log). We do not use the bytes written; although the CPU might issue word writes, the caching system typically writes data back to memory at cache line granularity. Workloads. We ran our system under seven transactional workloads. These workloads cover data structures that are commonly used in storage systems and cover different access patterns. SPS workloads randomly swap elements in a large array. HT-uni, RBT-uni, and BT-uni insert/delete nodes in a hash table, red-black tree, and B-tree (respectively) in a uniformly random fashion. HTzipf, RBT-zipf, and BT-zipf insert/delete nodes in a hash table, red-black tree, and B-tree (respectively) following a Zipf distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The elements, keys or values used in these workloads are all 8-byte integers. The footprints of these workloads range from 1 GB to 6 GB.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: TLB miss ratio loads for using OSP. However, OSP is still able to save 17% of CPU flushes. Analysis. We break down CPU flushes into three sources, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4b</ref>, for OSP transactions. We make two observations. First, better temporal locality leads to lower page consolidation overhead. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, workloads HT-zipf and RBT-zipf have noticeably lower TLB miss ratios, which means less page consolidations caused by evictions, than workloads HT-uni and RBT-uni. As a result, we observe fewer CPU flushes caused by page consolidations in workloads HT-zipf and RBT-zif than in their counterparts. Second, better spatial locality leads to lower journaling overhead. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4b</ref> shows that journaling only contributes a minor portion of the total CPU flushes in workload BT-uni because BTree is optimized for the better spatial locality. Better locality allows updates within a transaction to touch as few virtual pages as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Results</head><p>To sum up, OSP incurs comparable CPU flushes (1.2× fewer in our experiments) than logging when workloads has poor locality. However, OSP eliminates nearly all of the storage consistency cost for workloads with good locality. For example, in workload BT-zipf, 98% of CPU flushes come from persisting new updates (in-place updates) that are necessary for data persistence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Related Work</head><p>BNVM-aware Data Structures and Systems. BNVMaware data structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23]</ref> only focus on reducing storage consistency costs for particular data structures. In contrast, OSP transactions support atomic and durable updates of any data structure. Lightweight Persistent Memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20]</ref> and BNVM-aware file systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22]</ref> provide programming support for NonVolatile Memory, but they use either undo/undo logging or shadow page to build durable transactions. OSP can help make these approaches more efficient. Reducing Storage Consistency Cost. Like OSP, both Kamino-TX <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref> and LSNVMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> attempt to reduce the persistence overhead by eliminating the need to log actual data. Kamino-TX maintains another backup, and LSNVMM uses log-structured updates. However, both of them have inefficiencies. LSNVMM introduces significant address remapping overhead by adding another indirection in userspace, and Kamino-TX still needs to apply updates to backup asynchronously. DudeTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref> enjoys the benefits of a redo-log (fewer CPU flushes/barriers) while avoiding the drawbacks (address remapping overhead). However, DudeTM still must log the actual data and apply updates to persistent storage afterward. In comparison, OSP requires no costly software mapping, need not write the actual data twice, and doesn't need to apply the updates afterward. Virtual Memory Systems. Page overlay <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> aims to provide fine-grained memory management. However, page overlay semantics don't allow us to build durable transactions efficiently, since page consolidations are required for every transaction commit. Instead, with OSP semantics, we only need to do page consolidations upon TLB evictions. EXCITE-VM <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref> leverages the indirection of virtual memory to build more efficient snapshot isolation transactions, but it doesn't address the durability issue for transactions on non-volatile memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>OSP extends shadow paging with cache line level mappings, allowing durable transactions to be implemented without the need to log actual data for each update and without incurring unnecessary persisting overhead. Our preliminary results show that OSP can reduce overall CPU flushes, including CPU flushes used to persist new updates, by 1.2-1.96× as compared to undo-log. We also show that OSP is able to provide a strong storage consistency guarantee with almost no cost for workloads with decent locality.</p><p>In our future work, we will investigate integrating our OSP transaction with Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) to provide general, ACID transactions. OSP is ideally suited for HTM because it allows speculative updates to BNVM with nearly free rollback. Our future work will also address issues such as correct and efficient TLB shootdown and managing transactions that don't fit in the TLB. We also plan to investigate optimizations such as asynchronous page consolidation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1: Two states of a virtual page.</figDesc></figure>

For transactions that only update a single virtual page, we are able to update a committed bitmap stored in the consistent state table atomically (8 bytes atomic in-place update). However, some transactions may update mul- tiple virtual pages, so we must use journaling to atomi- cally update multiple committed bitmaps in the consis- tent state table. OSP journaling is lightweight since we only need to record the updated bitmap as well as a small amount of other information (e.g., virtual page number which can be used to uniquely identify a tuple in the con- sistent state table). Super Pages for Multi-page Transactions. As an alter- native to journaling, we can transform multi-page trans- actions into single-page transactions using super pages. We reserve a super page for each address space to store the consistent state table. Super pages are themselves up- dated with OSP semantics. When a transaction is com- mitted, we persist the new updates, update the consistent state table stored in the super page, and perform a single- page transaction commit for the super page. Under this mechanism, the OS need only maintain a persistent super page table which keeps consistent states of super pages. For the rest of this paper, we assume lightweight journal- ing is used for multi-page atomicity.</figDesc><table></table></figure>
