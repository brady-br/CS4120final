				<p>This paper presents NetSieve, a system that aims to do automated problem inference from network trouble tickets. Network trouble tickets are diaries comprising fixed fields and free-form text written by operators to document the steps while troubleshooting a problem. Unfortunately , while tickets carry valuable information for network management, analyzing them to do problem inference is extremely difficult-fixed fields are often inaccurate or incomplete, and the free-form text is mostly written in natural language. This paper takes a practical step towards automatically analyzing natural language text in network tickets to infer the problem symptoms, troubleshooting activities and resolution actions. Our system, NetSieve, combines statistical natural language processing (NLP), knowledge representation, and ontology modeling to achieve these goals. To cope with ambiguity in free-form text, NetSieve leverages learning from human guidance to improve its inference accuracy. We evaluate NetSieve on 10K+ tickets from a large cloud provider, and compare its accuracy using (a) an expert review, (b) a study with operators, and (c) vendor data that tracks device replacement and repairs. Our results show that NetSieve achieves 89%-100% accuracy and its inference output is useful to learn global problem trends. We have used NetSieve in several key network operations: analyzing device failure trends, understanding why network redundancy fails, and identifying device problem symptoms.</p>

To track network troubleshooting and maintenance, operators typically deploy a trouble ticket system which logs all the steps from opening a ticket (e.g., customer complaint, SNMP alarm) till its resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Trouble tickets comprise two types of fields: (a) structured data of- * Work done during an internship at Microsoft Research, Redmond. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.5 continuously rebooting</head><p>As discussed, the device has bad memory chips as such we replace it. Please completely fill the RMA form below and return it. ten generated automatically by alarm systems such as ticket id, time of alert, and syslog error, and (b) freeform text written by operators to record the diagnosis steps and communication (e.g., via IM, email) with the customer or other technicians while mitigating the problem. Even though the free-form field is less regular and precise compared to the fixed text, it usually provides a detailed view of the problem: what happened? what troubleshooting was done? and what was the resolution? <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows a ticket describing continuous reboots of a load balancer even after reseating its power supply units; bad memory as the root cause; and memory replacement as the fix; which would be hard to infer from coarse-grained fixed data. Unfortunately, while tickets contain valuable information to infer problem trends and improve network management, mining them automatically is extremely hard. On one hand, the fixed fields are often inaccurate or incomplete <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Our analysis ( ยง2.1) on a large ticket dataset shows that the designated problem type and subtype fields had incorrect or inconclusive information in 69% and 75% of the tickets, respectively. On the other hand, since the free-form text is written in natural language, it is often ambiguous and contains typos, grammatical errors, and words (e.g., "cable", "line card", "power supply") having domain-specific meanings different from the dictionary. Given these fundamental challenges, it becomes difficult to automatically extract meaning from raw ticket text even with advanced NLP techniques, which are designed to process well-written text (e.g., news articles) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Most prior work on mining trouble tickets use either keyword search and manual processing of free-form content <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>, predefined rule set from ticket history <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, or document clustering based on manual keyword selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. While these approaches are simple to implement and can help narrow down the types of problems to examine, they risk (1) inaccuracy as they consider only the presence of a keyword regardless of where it appears (e.g., "do not replace the cable" specifies a negation) and its relationship to other words (e.g., "checking for maintenance" does not clarify whether the ticket was actually due to maintenance), (2) a significant human effort to build the keyword list and repeating the process for new tickets, and (3) inflexibility due to predefined rule sets as they do not cover unexpected incidents or become outdated as the network evolves. Our Contributions. This paper presents NetSieve, a problem inference system that aims to automatically analyze ticket text written in natural language to infer the problem symptoms, troubleshooting activities, and resolution actions. Since it is nearly impractical to understand any arbitrary text, NetSieve adopts a domainspecific approach to first build a knowledge base using existing tickets, automatically to the extent possible, and then use it to do problem inference. While a ticket may contain multiple pieces of useful information, NetSieve focuses on inferring three key features for summarization as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1:</ref> 1. Problems denote the network entity (e.g., router, link, power supply unit) and its associated state, condition or symptoms (e.g., crash, defective, reboot) as identified by an operator e.g., bad memory, line card failure, crash of a load balancer. 2. Activities indicate the steps performed on the network entity during troubleshooting e.g., clean and swap cables, verify hard disk drive, run configuration script. 3. Actions represent the resolution action(s) performed on the network entity to mitigate the problem e.g., upgrade BIOS, rehome servers, reseat power supply.</p><p>To achieve this functionality, NetSieve combines techniques from several areas in a novel way to perform problem inference over three phases. First, it constructs a domain-specific knowledge base and an ontology model to interpret the free-form text using pattern mining and statistical NLP. In particular, it finds important domainspecific words and phrases (e.g., "supervisor engine", "kernel", "configuration") and then maps them onto the ontology model to specify relationships between them. Second, it applies this knowledge base to infer problems, activities and actions from tickets and exports the inference output for summarization and trend analysis. Third, to improve the inference accuracy, NetSieve performs incremental learning to incorporate human feedback. Our evaluation on 10K+ network tickets from a large cloud provider shows that NetSieve performs automated problem inference with 89%-100% accuracy, and several network teams in that cloud provider have used its inference output to learn global problem trends: (1) compare device reliability across platforms and vendors, (2) analyze cases when network redundancy failover is ineffective, and (3) prioritize checking for the top-k problems and failing components during network troubleshooting. This paper makes the following contributions:</p><p>โข A large-scale measurement study ( ยง2) to highlight the challenges in analyzing structured data and free-form text in network trouble tickets.</p><p>โข Design and implementation ( ยง3) of NetSieve, an automated inference system that analyzes free-form text in tickets to extract the problem symptoms, troubleshooting activities and resolution actions.</p><p>โข Evaluation ( ยง4) of NetSieve using expert review, study with network operators and vendor data, and showing its applicability ( ยง5) to improve network management.</p><p>Scope and Limitations: NetSieve is based on analyzing free-form text written by operators. Thus, its accuracy is dependent on (a) fidelity of the operators' input and (b) tickets containing sufficient information for inference. NetSieve leverages NLP techniques, and hence is subject to their well-known limitations such as ambiguities caused by anaphoras (e.g., referring to a router as this), complex negations (e.g., "device gets replaced" but later in the ticket, the action is negated by the use of an anaphora) and truth conditions (e.g., "please replace the unit once you get more in stock" does not clarify whether the unit has been replaced). NetSieve inference rules may be specific to our ticket data and may not apply to other networks. While we cannot establish representativeness, this concern is alleviated to some extent by the size and diversity of our dataset. Finally, our ontology model represents one way of building a knowledge base, based on discussions with operators. Given that the ticket system is subjective and domain-specific, alternative approaches may work better for other systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Measurement and Challenges</head><p>In this section, we present a measurement study to highlight the key challenges in automated problem inference from network tickets. The dataset comprises 10K+ (absolute counts omitted due to confidentiality reasons) network tickets logged during April 2010-2012 from a large cloud provider. Next, we describe the challenges in analyzing fixed fields and free-form text in trouble tickets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Challenges: Analyzing Fixed Fields</head><p>C1: Coarse granularity. The fixed fields in tickets contain attributes such as 'ProblemType' and 'ProblemSubType', which are either pre-populated by alarm systems or filled in by operators. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the top-10 problem types and sub-types along-with the fraction of  tickets. Sev denotes problem severity assigned based on SLAs with the customer. We observe that while problem types such as Software, Hardware, Maintenance, and Incident provide coarse granularity information about the problem type, other types e.g., Sev <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> are highly subjective reflecting operator's judgement and they account for 68.8% of the tickets. As a result, these fields are not useful to precisely infer the observed problems. C2: Inaccuracy or Incompleteness. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> shows the problem categorization for a randomly selected subset of tickets labeled by a domain expert (top) and the field values from the tickets (bottom) for three different types of devices: (1) Access Routers (AR), (2) Firewalls, and (3) Load balancers (LB); the number of tickets is 300, 42, and 299, respectively. We make two key observations. First, the Problem SubType field (in the bottom row) is Unknown in about 79%-87% of the tickets. As a result, we may incorrectly infer that devices failed due to unknown problems, whereas the problems were precisely reported in the expert labeled set based on the same ticket data. Second, the categories annotated by the expert and ticket fields for each device type have little overlap, and even when there is a common category, there is a significant difference in the fraction of tickets attributed to that category e.g., 'Cable' accounts for 0.6% of the LB tickets whereas the ground truth shows their contribution to be 9.7%.</p><p>The reason that these fields are inaccurate or incomplete is that operators work under a tight time schedule, and they usually have a narrow focus of mitigating a problem rather than analyzing failure trends. Thus, they may not have the time, may not be motivated, or simply forget to input precise data for these fields after closing the tickets. Further, some fixed fields have a drop-down menu of pre-defined labels and every problem may not be easily described using them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Challenges: Analyzing Free-form Text</head><p>In comparison to structured data, the free-form text in network tickets is descriptive and ambiguous: it has <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref>  domain-specific words and synonyms mixed with regular dictionary words, spelling and grammar errors, and writings from different operators. Specifically, we highlight the following challenges in mining free-form text in trouble tickets: C1: Diversity of content. A ticket may contain a variety of semantic elements such as emails, IMs, device debug logs, devices names, and operator notes. C2: Domain-specific words. Without a prior list of domain-specific keywords, training spell checkers can be hard e.g., DMZ and DNS are both valid technical keywords, but they cannot be found in the dictionary. C3: Redundant text. Tickets often contain text fragments that appear with high frequency. We observe three types of frequently occurring fragments (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>): templates, emails and device logs. Templates are text fragments added by operators to meet triage guidelines, but they often do not contain any problem-specific information. Many emails are asynchronous replies to a previous message and thus, it may be hard to reconstruct the message order for inference. Log messages are usually appended to a ticket in progress. Therefore, text mining using metrics such as term frequency may incorrectly give more weightage to terms that appear in these logs.</p><p>Overall, these challenges highlight the difficulty in automatically inferring problems from tickets. While we studied only our ticket dataset, our conversation with operators (having a broader industry view and some having worked at other networks), suggests that these challenges are similar to those of many other systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Design and Implementation</head><p>In this section, we first give an overview of NetSieve and then describe its design and implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Design Goals</head><p>To automatically analyze free-form text, NetSieve should meet the following design goals:</p><p>1. Accuracy: The inference system needs to be accurate as incorrect inference can lead to bad operator decisions, and wasted time and effort in validating inference output for each ticket, thus limiting practicality. 2. Automation: Although we cannot completely eliminate humans from the loop, the system should be able to operate as autonomously as possible. 3. Adaptation: As the network evolves, the system should be able to analyze new types of problems and leverage human feedback to acquire new knowledge for continuously improving the inference accuracy. 4. Scalability: The system should be scalable to process a large number of tickets where each ticket may comprise up to a million characters, in a reasonable time. 5. Usability: The output from the inference system should provide a user-friendly interface (e.g., visualization, REST, plaintext) to allow the operator to browse, filter and process the inference output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Overview</head><p>NetSieve infers three key features from network trouble tickets: (1) Problem symptoms indicating what problem occurred, (2) Troubleshooting activities describing the diagnostic steps, and (3) Resolution actions denoting the fix applied to mitigate the problem. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows an overview of the NetSieve architecture. NetSieve operates in three phases. First, the knowledge building phase constructs a domain-specific knowledge base and an ontology model using existing tickets and input from a domain-expert. Second, the operational phase uses the knowledge base to make problem inference from tickets. Third, the incremental learning phase improves the accuracy of knowledge base using human guidance. We next give a brief description of each of these phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge Building Phase: The goal of this phase is</head><p>to analyze free-form text to extract important domainspecific phrases such as "power supply unit" and "load balancer" using repeated pattern mining ( ยง3.3.1) and statistical NLP ( ยง3.3.2). These domain-specific phrases are then mapped onto an ontology model ( ยง3.3.3) that formally represents the relationships between network entities and stores them in a knowledge base. This phase is executed either when NetSieve is bootstrapped or to retrain the system using expert feedback. Operational Phase: The goal of this phase is to perform problem inference ( ยง3.4) from a ticket using the knowledge base. To export the inference output, NetSieve supports SQL (through the Query Engine) and HTTP GET requests (through a Query Interface such as REST <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) and outputs results in a variety of data formats such as XML/JSON, and through data visualization for ticket summarization and trend analysis. Incremental Learning Phase: To improve inference accuracy, it is important to continuously update the knowledge base to incorporate any new domain-specific terminologies. NetSieve provides an interface to allow a domain-expert to give feedback for improving the ontology model, synonyms, blacklists and whitelists. After each learning session, NetSieve performs problem inference using the updated knowledge base.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Knowledge Building Phase</head><p>Building a domain-specific knowledge phase requires addressing three key questions. First, what type of information should be extracted from the free-form text to enable problem inference? Second, how do we extract this information in a scalable manner from a large ticket corpus? Third, how do we model the relationships in the extracted information to infer meaning from the ticket content. Next we describe solutions to these questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Repeated Pattern Extraction</head><p>Intuitively, the phrases that would be most useful to build a knowledge base should capture domain-specific information and be related to hot (common) and important problem types. As mining arbitrary ticket text is extremely hard ( ยง2), we first extract hot phrases and later apply filters ( ยง3.3.2) to select the important ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESIGN:</head><p>To find the hot phrases from ticket text, we initially applied conventional text mining techniques for n-gram extraction. N-grams are arbitrary and recurrent word combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> that are repeated in a given context <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Since network tickets have no inherent linguistic model, we extracted n-grams of arbitrary length for comprehensive analysis without limiting to bi-grams or tri-grams. We implemented several advanced techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref> from computational linguistics and NLP, and observed the following challenges:</p><p>1. Extracting all possible n-grams can be computationally expensive for a large n and is heavily dependent on the size of the corpus. We investigated using a popular technique by <ref type="bibr">Nagao</ref>   55] is difficult when the corpus size is large. 3. Not all n-grams are useful due to their semantic context. For instance, n-grams such as "showing green" (LED status) and "unracking the" (unmounting the server) occurred frequently together but they do not contribute to the domain knowledge.</p><p>To address these challenges, we trade completeness in n-gram extraction for scalability and speedup. Our idea to extract hot patterns is to use a data compression algorithm, typically used to compress files by finding recurring patterns in the data and encoding them. A dictionary is maintained to map the repeated patterns to their output codes. Clearly, these dictionaries do not include all possible n-grams, but they contain hot patterns that are frequent enough to bootstrap the knowledge base.</p><p>Data compression algorithms typically operate at a byte or character level, and they do not output the frequency of patterns in their dictionary. To address these issues, NetSieve performs pattern extraction in two </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Email snippets</head><p>if you need assistance outside of these hours please call into the htts toll free number 1 800 phases ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>). First, it tokenizes input into sentences and leverages LZW <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> to develop a word-level LZW encoder (WLZW) that builds a dictionary of repeated patterns at the word-level. In the second phase, NetSieve applies the Aho-Corasick algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to output frequency of the repeated phrases. Aho-Corasick is a string matching algorithm that runs in a single-pass and has a complexity linear in the pattern length, input size and the number of output matches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLEMENTATION:</head><p>We implemented the two phase pattern extraction algorithm in Cython <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, that allows translating Python into optimized C/C++ code. To optimize performance, we implemented the Aho-Corasick algorithm using suffix-trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> as opposed to the conventional suffix-arrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. As expected, we achieved a 5x-20x performance improvement using Cython compared to a Python-based solution ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6(a)</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>(b) shows the performance comparison of WLZW to Nagao (f=10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> which extracts all n-grams that occur at least 10 times. The latter terminated due to insufficient memory for a million word document. In comparison, NetSieve is able to process documents containing 100 million words in under 2.7 hours.</p><p>Note that WLZW is one way to extract hot patterns; we will explore other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref> in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Knowledge Discovery</head><p>The goal of the knowledge discovery phase is to filter important domain-specific patterns from the extracted set in the previous phase; <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> shows examples of the extracted phrases. We define a pattern as important when it contributes to understanding of the "central topic" in a ticket. Consider the following excerpt from a ticket:</p><p>We found that the device &lt;name&gt; Power LED is amber and it is in hung state. This device has silver power supply. We need to change the silver power supply to black. We will let you know once the power supply is changed.</p><p>The central topic of the above excerpt is "device failure that requires a power supply unit to be changed" and the  phrases in bold are relevant. While the pattern extractor outputs these phrases as repeated patterns, the key challenge is how to distinguish them from noisy patterns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESIGN:</head><p>An intuitive method is to select the most frequently occurring patterns as important. However, we observed that many of them were warning messages which did not contribute to the central topic. Therefore, we apply a pipeline of three filters to identify the important domain-specific patterns.</p><p>Phrase Length/Frequency Filter: The idea behind applying this filter is that both the length and frequency of a phrase can act as good indicators of its importance. Intuitively, we are interested in phrases of short-length, but having a high-frequency. The rationale is that the other length-frequency combinations are either noise, occur due to typos, or can be constructed using short phrases.</p><p>We did not use a spell checker because an untrained or an undertrained one may incorrectly modify domain-specific words such as DNS and DMZ, and the probability of an important domain-specific phrase having typos in a large fraction of tickets is likely small. We plot the distribution of length and frequency of phrases ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7)</ref> and then manually inspect a random subset in each quartile to derive heuristics for threshold-based filtering <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Part-Of-Speech (PoS) Filter:</head><p>The second filter is based on the seminal work of Justeson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. They postulate that technical terms or domain-specific phrases have no satisfactory formal definition and can only be intuitively characterized: they generally occur only in specialized types of usage and are often specific to subsets of domains. Specifically, they conclude that most technical phrases contain only nouns and adjectives after analyzing four major technical dictionaries and subsequently provide a set of seven patterns outlined   <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. We build upon these patterns and map them to state-of-the-art Penn Treebank tagset <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, a simplified part-of-speech tagset for English, using regular expressions <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 4)</ref>. Further, this mapping allows our implementation to leverage existing part-of-speech taggers of natural language toolkits such as NLTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and SharpNLP <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>. Filtering takes place in two steps: (1) each input phrase is tagged with its associated part-of-speech tags, and (2) the part-of-speech pattern is discarded if it fails to match a pattern.</p><p>Entropy Filter: The third filter uses information theory to filter statistically insignificant phrases, and sorts them based on importance to aid manual labeling. We achieve this by computing two metrics for each phrase [52]:</p><p>1. Mutual Information (MI): MI(x, y) compares the probability of observing word x and word y together (the joint probability) with the probabilities of observing x and y independently. For a phrase pattern, MI is computed by the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">MI(xY z) = log ๑ฎฝ t f (xY z) * t f (Y ) t f (xY ) * t f (Y z) ๑ฎฝ<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where xY z is a phrase pattern, x and z are a word/char-acter and Y is a sub-phrase or sub-string, t f denotes the term-frequency of a word or phrase in the corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Residual Inverse Document Frequency (RIDF):</head><p>RIDF is the difference between the observed IDF and what would be expected under a Poisson model for a random word or phrase with comparable frequency. RIDF of a phrase is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">RIDF = โ log ๑ฎฝ d f D ๑ฎฝ + log ๑ฎฝ 1 โ exp( โt f D ) ๑ฎฝ (2)</formula><p>where d f denotes the document-frequency (the number of tickets which contain the phrase) and D as the total number of tickets.</p><p>Phrases with high RIDF or MI have distributions that cannot be attributed to chance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. In particular, MI aims to pick vocabulary expected in a dictionary, while RIDF aims to select domain-specific keywords, not likely to exist in a general dictionary. We investigated both metrics as they are orthogonal and that each tends to separately pick interesting phrases <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLEMENTATION:</head><p>The three filters are applied as a sequential pipeline and are implemented in Python. For PoS tagging, we utilize the Stanford Log-Linear PoS Tagger <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> as an add-on module to the Natural Language Toolkit <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and implement a multi-threaded tagger that uses the phrase length/frequency filter to first filter a list of candidate phrases for tagging. After applying the threshold-based filtering and PoS filters on the input 18.85M phrases, RIDF and MI are computed for the remaining 187K phrases. This step significantly reduced the computational cost compared to prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, which aim to compute statistics for all n-grams. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, we did not observe strong correlation between RIDF and MI <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref> (top)). We relied solely on RIDF because most phrases with high MI were already filtered by RIDF and the remaining ones contained terms not useful in our context.</p><p>The bottom graph of <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the CCDF plot of RIDF which can be used to set a threshold to narrow down the phrase list for the next stage of human review. Determining the threshold poses a trade off between the completeness of the domain-dictionary and the human effort required to analyze the extracted patterns. In our prototype, we set the threshold based on RIDF such that 3% (5.6K) of the total phrases (187K) are preserved. Further, we sort these phrase patterns based on RIDF for expert review as phrases with higher values get labeled quickly. An expert sifted through the 5.6K phrases <ref type="figure">(Fig- ure 9</ref>) and selected 1.6K phrase patterns that we consider as ground truth, in less than four hours. We observed that most of the discarded patterns were redundant as they can be constructed from the ground truth patterns. While we leverage manual review to obtain the ground truth, this is a necessary step for any supervised technique. We plan to explore other techniques such as Named-Entity Recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and using domain experts for crowdsourcing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> to automate this step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Ontology Modeling</head><p>The goal of building ontology models is to determine semantic interpretation of important domain-specific phrases generated by the knowledge discovery stage. For instance, between the terms slot and memory slot, we are looking for the latter term with high specificity. Intuitively, we need to model an ontology where domainspecific phrases have a concrete meaning and can be combined together to enable semantic interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESIGN:</head><p>Developing an ontology model involves three steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>: (1) defining classes in the ontology, (2) arranging the classes in a taxonomic (superclass, subclass) hierarchy and (3) defining interactions amongst the classes. Note that defining an ontology is highly domainspecific and depends on extensions anticipated by the domain-expert. We designed and embedded one such ontology into NetSieve based on discussion with operators. Below, we discuss the design rationale behind the classes, taxonomies and interactions in our model. Classes and Taxonomies: A class describes a concept in a given domain. For example, a class of entities can represent all devices (e.g., routers, load balancers and cables) and a class of conditions can represent all possible states of an entity (e.g., bad, flapping, faulty). A domain-expert sifted through the 1.6K phrases from previous stage and after a few iterations, identified seven classes to describe the phrases, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref>. Taxonomic Hierarchy: To enable fine-grained problem inference, Entity is divided into three sub-classes: Replaceable denoting entities that can be physically replaced, Virtual denoting entities that are intangible and Maintenance denoting entities that can "act" upon other entities. Actions are sub-classed in a similar way. The rest of the classes can be considered as qualifiers for Entities and Actions. Qualifiers, in general, act as adjectives or adverbs and give useful information about an Entity or Action. In the final iteration, our domain-expert split each of the 1.6K long phrase patterns into their constituent small phrase patterns and tagged them with the most specific class that captured the phrase e.g., "and gbic replacement" โ [(and, OMIT WORD), (gbic, ReplaceableEntity),(replacement, PhysicalAction)]. Most of these tagged phrases are domain-specific multi-word phrases and are not found in a dictionary. While the words describing Entities were not ambiguous, we found a few cases where other classes were ambiguous. For instance, phrases such as "power supply" (hardware unit or power line), "bit errors" (memory or network link), "port channel" (logical link bundling or virtual link), "flash memory" (memory reset or type of memory), "device reload" and "interface reset" (unexpected or planned), and "key corruption" (crypto-key or license-key) were hard to understand without a proper context. To address this ambiguity, we use the text surrounding these phrases to infer their intent ( ยง3.4).</p><p>Finally, using these mappings, NetSieve embeds a ClassTagger module that given an input, outputs tags for words that have an associated class mapping.</p><p>Interactions: An interaction describes relationships amongst the various classes in the ontology model. For instance, there are valid interactions (an Action can be caused upon an Entity) and invalid interactions (an Entity cannot describe a Sentiment). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows our model comprising interactions amongst the classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLEMENTATION:</head><p>We obtained 0.6K phrases from the 1.6K phrases in ยง3.3.2 categorized into the seven classes. We implemented the ClassTagger using a trie constructed using NetSieve knowledge base of domain- specific phrases, and a dictionary of their ontology mappings. The tagging procedure works in three steps. First, the input is tokenized into sentences. Second, using the trie, a search is performed for the longest matching phrase in each sentence to build a list of domainspecific keywords e.g., in the sentence "the power supply is down", both "supply" and "power supply" are valid domain keywords, but the ClassTagger marks "power supply" as the relevant word. Finally, these keywords are mapped to their respective ontology classes using the dictionary. For instance, given the snippet from ยง3.3.2, the ClassTagger will produce the following output:</p><p>We found that the (device) / ReplaceableEntity &lt;name&gt; (Power LED) / ReplaceableEntity is (amber) / Condition and it is in (hung state) / ProblemCondition. This device has (silver) / Condition (power supply) / ReplaceableEntity. We need to change the (silver) / Condition (power supply) / ReplaceableEntity to (black) / Condition. We will let you know once the (power supply) / ReplaceableEntity is (changed) / PhysicalAction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Operational Phase</head><p>The goal of this phase is to leverage the knowledge base to do automated problem inference on trouble tickets. A key challenge to address is how to establish a relationship between the ontology model and the physical world. In particular, we want to map certain interactions from our ontology model to concepts that allow summarizing a given ticket.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESIGN:</head><p>Our discussion with operators revealed a common ask to answer three main questions: (1) What was observed when a problem was logged?, (2) What activities were performed as part of troubleshooting? and (3) What was the final action taken to resolve the problem? Based on these requirements, we define three key concepts that can be extracted using our ontology model (Table 6): (1) Problems denote the state or condition of an entity, (2) Activities describe the troubleshooting steps, and (3) Actions capture the problem resolution.</p><p>The structure of concepts can be identified by sampling tickets describing different types of problems. We randomly sampled 500 tickets out of our expert-labeled ground truth data describing problems related to different device and link types. We pass these tickets through NetSieve's ClassTagger and get a total of 9.5K tagged snippets. We observed a common linguistic structure in them: in more than 90% of the cases, the action/condition that relates to an entity appears in the same sentence i.e., information can be inferred about an entity based on its neighboring words. Based on this observation, we derived three patterns ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 6</ref>) that capture all the cases of interest. Intuitively, we are interested in finding instances where an action or a condition precedes/succeeds an entity. Based on the fine granularity of the sub-classes, the utility of the concepts extracted increases i.e., PhysicalAction was taken on a ReplacableEntity is more important than Action was taken on an Entity.</p><p>This type of a proximity-search is performed once for each of the three concepts. First, the ClassTagger produces a list of phrases along with their associated tags. Second, we check to see if the list of tags contain an action/condition. Once such a match is found in a sentence, the phrase associated with the action/condition is added to a dictionary as a key and all entities within its neighborhood are added as corresponding values. We implemented several additional features like negation detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and synonym substitution to remove any ambiguities in the inference output.</p><p>EXAMPLE: "The load balancer was down. We checked the cables. This was due to a faulty power supply unit which was later replaced", is tagged as "The (load balancer) / ReplaceableEntity was (down) / ProblemCondition. We (checked) / MaintenanceAction the (cables) / ReplaceableEntity. This was due to a (faulty) / ProblemCondition (power supply unit) / ReplaceableEntity which was later (replaced) / PhysicalAction". Next, a dictionary is built for each of the three concepts. Two classes are associated if they are direct neighbors. In this example, the output is the following:</p><p>[+] Problems -{down: load balancer, power supply unit} [+] Activities -{checked: cable} [+] Actions -{replaced: power supply unit} In the final stage, the word "replaced" is changed into "replace" and "checked" into "check" using a dictionary of synonyms provided by the domain-expert to remove any ambiguities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLEMENTATION:</head><p>We implemented our inference logic using Python. Each ticket is first tokenized into sentences and each sentence is then used for concept inference. After extracting the concepts and their associated entities, we store the results in a SQL table. Our implementation is able to do problem inference at the rate of 8 tickets/sec on average on our server, which scales to 28,800 tickets/hour; note that this time depends on the ticket size, and the overhead is mainly due to text processing and part-of-speech tagging.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluating NetSieve Accuracy</head><p>To test NetSieve's accuracy, we randomly divided our two year ticket dataset into training and test data. The test data consists of 155 tickets on device replacements and repairs from two network vendors and 696 tickets labeled by a domain expert while the training data comprises the rest of the tickets. We use the training data to build NetSieve's knowledge base. The domain expert read the original ticket to extract the ground truth in terms of Problems and Actions, which was then compared with corresponding phrases in the inference output. <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 7</ref> shows the overall results by NetSieve on the test dataset. On the expert labeled data, we observe the precision of NetSieve to be 1, minimum recall value to be 0.964 for Problems and 0.942 for Actions, F-score of 0.981-1 for Problems and 0.970-1 for Actions, and accuracy percentage to be 96.4%-100% for Problems and 94.3%-100% for Actions. These results indicate that NetSieve provides useful inference with reasonable accuracy in analyzing network tickets.</p><p>Next, we validate the inference output against data from two network device vendors that record the ground truth based on the diagnosis of faulty devices or components sent back to the vendor. Each vendor-summary reported the root cause of the failure (similar to NetSieve's Problems) and what was done to fix the problem (similar to NetSieve's Actions). We obtained vendor data corresponding to total 155 tickets on load balancers and core routers from our dataset. Since the vocabulary in the vendor data comprised new, vendor-specific words and synonyms not present in our knowledge base (e.g., port interface mentioned as 'PME'), we asked a domainexpert to validate if NetSieve's inference summary covers the root cause and the resolution described in the vendor data. For instance, if the vendor data denoted that a router failed due to a faulty supervisor engine (SUP), the expert checked if NetSieve captures "failed device" under Problems and "replaced SUP" under Actions.</p><p>The accuracy of NetSieve on the vendor data is observed to be 97.3%-100% for Problems and 89.6%-100% for Actions. One reason for relatively lower accuracy for Actions on this dataset is due to a small number of false negatives: the corrective action applied at the vendor site may differ from our ticket set as the vendor has the expert knowledge to fix problems specific to their devices.</p><p>Overall, NetSieve has reasonable accuracy of 96.4%-100% for Problems and 89.6%-100% for Actions, measured based on the labeled test dataset. We observed similar results for Activities and thus omit them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluating Usability of NetSieve</head><p>We conducted a user study involving five operators to evaluate the usability of NetSieve for automated problem inference compared to the traditional method of manually analyzing tickets. Each operator was shown 20 tickets selected at random from our dataset and asked to analyze the type of problems observed, activities and actions. Then, the operator was shown NetSieve inference summary of each ticket and asked to validate it against their manually labeled ground truth. We measured the accuracy, speed and user preference in the survey. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows the accuracy and time to manually read the ticket versus the NetSieve inference summary across the operators. We observed average accuracy of 83%-100% and a significant decrease in time taken to manually read the ticket from 95P of 480s to 95P of 22s for NetSieve. NetSieve Inference Summaries Tickets <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>: Accuracy obtained from the user survey (top). CDF of time to read tickets and inference summaries (bottom).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Deployment and Impact</head><p>NetSieve has been deployed in the cloud provider we studied to enable operators to understand global problem trends instead of making decisions based on isolated incidents. Further, NetSieve complements existing tools (e.g., inventory db) by correlating device replacements with their failures and problem root causes. A simple alternative to mining tickets using NetSieve is to ask operators for explicit feedback e.g., to build <ref type="table">Table 8</ref>, but it will likely be biased by anecdotal or recent data. Currently, our NetSieve prototype supports SQL-like queries on the inference output. For instance, "SELECT TOP 5 Problems FROM InferenceDB WHERE DeviceType = 'Load Balancer' would output the top-5 failure problems observed across load balancers.</p><p>Next, we present how NetSieve has been used across different teams to improve network management. Network Architecture: This team used NetSieve to compare device reliability across platforms and vendors.</p><p>In one instance, NetSieve showed that a new generation of feature-rich, high capacity AR is half as reliable as its predecessor. In another instance, it showed that software bugs dominated failures in one type of load balancers. Based on grouping tickets having Problem inference of Switch Card Control Processor (SCCP) watchdog timeout for LB-2, NetSieve showed that hundreds of devices exhibited reboot loops due to a recurring software bug and were RMAed in 88% of the tickets. Capacity Planning: This team applied NetSieve to analyze cases when network redundancy is ineffective in masking failures. Specifically, for each network failure, we evaluate if the redundancy failover was not successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and then select the corresponding tickets. These tickets are then input to NetSieve to do problem inference which output the following to be the dominant problems:</p><p>1. Faulty Cables: The main reason was that the cable connected to the backup was faulty. Thus, when the primary failed, it resulted in a high packet error rate. 2. Software Mismatch: When the primary and backup had mismatched OS versions, protocol incompatibility caused an unsuccessful failover. 3. Misconfiguration: Because operators usually configure one device and then copy the configuration onto the other, a typo in one script introduced the same bug in the other and resulted in an unsuccessful failover. 4. Faulty Failovers: The primary device failed when the backup was facing an unrelated problem such as software upgrade, down for scheduled repairs, or while deploying a new device into production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incident Management and Operations:</head><p>The incident management team used NetSieve to prioritize checking for the top-k problems and failing components while troubleshooting devices. The operation team uses NetSieve to determine if past repairs were effective and decide whether to repair or replace the device. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> shows NetSieve's inference output across different device types.We observe that while Problems show a high diversity across device types such as packet errors, line card failures and defective memory, verifying cable connectivity is a common troubleshooting activity, except for Firewalls and VPNs where operators first verify device configuration. For Actions related to Firewalls, VPNs and ToRs, the devices are first rebooted as a quick fix even though the failing components are likely to be bad cable or OS bugs. In many cases, we observe that a failed device is RMAed (sent back to the vendor) which implies that the network is operating at reduced or no redundancy until the replacement arrives. Complementary to the above scenarios, NetSieve inference can be applied in several other ways: (1) prioritize troubleshooting steps based on frequently observed problems on a given device, its platform, its datacenter, or the hosted application, (b) identify the top-k failing components in a device platform and resolving them with their vendors, and (c) decide whether to repair, replace or even retire a particular device or platform by computing a total cost-of-ownership (TCO) metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Network Troubleshooting: There has been a significant work in analyzing structured logs to learn statistical signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, run-time states <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> or leveraging router syslogs to infer problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Xu et al.</ref> [51] mine machine logs to detect runtime problems by leveraging the source code that generated the logs. NetSieve complements these approaches to automate problem inference from unstructured text. Expert systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, on the other hand, diagnose network faults based on a set of pre-programmed rules. However, they lack generality as they only diagnose faults in their ruleset and the ruleset may become outdated as the system evolves. In comparison, the incremental learning phase in NetSieve updates the knowledge base to improve the inference accuracy. Mining Network Logs: Prior efforts have focused on automating mining of network failures from syslogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref> or network logs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. However, these studies do not analyze free-form text in trouble tickets. Kandula et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> mine rules in edge networks based on traffic data. <ref type="bibr">Brauckhoff et al. [7]</ref> use association rule mining techniques to extract anomalies in backbone networks. NetSieve is complementary to these efforts in that their mining methodologies can benefit from our domain-specific knowledge base. TroubleMiner <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> selects keywords manually from the first two sentences in tickets and then performs clustering to group them. Analyzing Bug Reports: There is a large body of work in software engineering analyzing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, summarizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> bug reports. Betternburg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> rely on features found in bug reports such as stack traces, source code, patches and enumerations and, hence their approach is not directly applicable to network tickets. Others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> use standard NLP techniques for the task of clustering duplicate bug reports, but they suffer from the same limitations as keyword based approaches. In comparison, NetSieve aims to infer "meaning" from the free-form content by building a knowledge base and an ontology model to do problem inference. Natural Language Processing: N-gram extraction techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref>, 52] focus on extracting all possible n-grams thereby incurring a high computation cost for large datasets ( ยง3.3.1). NetSieve addresses this challenge by trading completeness for scalability and uses the dictionary built by its WLZW algorithm. Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> detect frequently occurring text fragments that have a high correlation with labels in large text corpora to detect issues in customer feedback. Other efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> achieve summarization via paragraph and sentence extraction. Much research in this area deals with properlywritten regular text and is not directly applicable to our domain. In contrast, NetSieve focuses on free-form text in trouble tickets to do problem inference.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>Network trouble tickets contain valuable information for network management, yet they are extremely difficult to analyze due to their free-form text. This paper takes a practical approach towards automatically analyzing the natural language text to do problem inference. We presented NetSieve that automatically analyzes ticket text to infer the problems observed, troubleshooting steps, and the resolution actions. Our results are encouraging: NetSieve achieves reasonable accuracy, is considered useful by operators and has been applied to answer several key questions for network management.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: An example network trouble ticket.</figDesc></figure>
