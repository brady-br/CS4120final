			<abstract>
				<p>The complexity of networks has outpaced our tools to debug them; today, administrators use manual tools to diagnose problems. In this paper, we show how packet histories-the full stories of every packet&apos;s journey through the network-can simplify network diagnosis. To demonstrate the usefulness of packet histories and the practical feasibility of constructing them, we built NetSight, an extensible platform that captures packet histories and enables applications to concisely and flexibly retrieve packet histories of interest. Atop NetSight, we built four applications that illustrate its flexibility: an interactive network debugger, a live invariant monitor, a path-aware history logger, and a hierarchical network profiler. On a single modern multi-core server, NetSight can process packet histories for the traffic of multiple 10 Gb/s links. For larger networks, NetSight scales linearly with additional servers and scales even further with straightforward additions to hardware-and hypervisor-based switches.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Operating networks is hard. When networks go down, administrators have only a rudimentary set of tools at their disposal (traceroute, ping, SNMP, NetFlow, sFlow) to track down the root cause of the outage. This debugging toolkit has remained essentially unchanged, despite an increase in distributed protocols that modify network state. Network administrators have become "masters of complexity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[40]</ref> who use their skill and experience to divine the root cause of each bug. Humans are involved almost every time something goes wrong, and we are still far from an era of automated troubleshooting.</p><p>We could easily diagnose many network problems if we could ask the network about suspect traffic and receive an immediate answer. For example: every packet history in the network, NetSight supports both real-time and postmortem analysis. Applications use Packet History Filter, a regex-like language that we developed, to concisely specify paths, switch state, and packet header fields for packet histories of interest. The fact that each application is less than 200 lines of code demonstrates the power of Packet History Filter in NetSight.</p><p>NetSight assembles packet histories using postcards-event records created whenever a packet traverses a switch. Each postcard contains a copy of the packet header, the switch ID, the output ports, and a version number for the switch forwarding state. To generate postcards, our prototype transparently interposes on the control channel between switches and controllers, and we have tested it with both hardware and software OpenFlow switches. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The challenge for any system offering packet histories is to efficiently and scalably process a stream of postcards into archived, queryable packet histories. Surprisingly, a single NetSight server suffices to assemble and store packet histories from packet headers collected at each hop, for every packet that crosses 14 routers in the Stanford backbone network. To support larger networks, NetSight scales out on general-purpose servers-increasing its assembly, query, and storage capabilities linearly with the number of processing cores, servers, and disks. To scale further to bandwidth-heavy enterprise and data center networks, we present two additional NetSight variants. NetSight-SwitchAssist proposes new switch hardware changes to reduce postcard bandwidth, while NetSight-HostAssist spreads postcard and history processing among virtualized servers. In contrast to the na¨ıvena¨ıve method of collecting packet headers that requires 31% bandwidth overhead in the average case ( §8), the SwitchAssist and HostAssist designs drastically reduce the bandwidth overhead to 7% and 3%, respectively ( §8).</p><p>To summarize, our contributions include:</p><p>• Language: Packet History Filter concisely represents packet histories of interest. ( §3) • Applications: a suite of network diagnosis apps built atop the NetSight API. ( §4) • Platform: the design ( §5), implementation ( §6), and evaluation ( §7) of NetSight.</p><p>• A discussion of the two other designs, NetSightSwitchAssist and NetSight-HostAssist ( §8).</p><p>This method of network analysis complements techniques that model network behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">24]</ref>. Rather than predict the forwarding behavior of hy-1 Our prototype uses OpenFlow but the design does not require it.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: A packet history shows the path taken by a packet along with the modifications and switch state encountered by it at each hop.</p><p>pothetical packets, NetSight shows the actual forwarding behavior of real packets. NetSight makes no assumptions about the correctness of network control software. However, it assumes that the hardware correctly forwards postcards to the NetSight server(s). If it doesn't, NetSight can flag it as a hardware error, but the information might not be helpful in accurately homing in on the root cause. Thus, NetSight helps network operators, control program developers, and switch implementers to discover and fix errors in firmware or control protocols that cause network elements to behave in unexpected ways. The source code of our NetSight prototype is publicly available with a permissive license <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. We encourage the readers to download, use, extend, and contribute to the codebase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Motivating Packet Histories</head><p>In this section, we define packet histories, show an example, note their challenges, and describe where Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can help.</p><p>Packet History Definition. A packet history tells the full story of a packet's journey through the network. More precisely, a packet history describes:</p><p>• what the packet looked like as it entered the network (headers) • where the packet was forwarded (switches + ports) • how it was changed (header modifications)</p><p>• why it was forwarded that way (matched flow/actions + flow table). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example packet history. Why Packet Histories? Put simply, packet histories provide direct evidence to diagnose network problems. For example, consider a WiFi handover problem we recently encountered <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref>. To diagnose the problem, our network admins started with pings. Then they collected and manually inspected forwarding rules. Then they visually parsed control plane logs, looking for the problem. After hours of debugging, they diagnosed the (surprisingly simple) cause: upon handover to a new AP, forwarding rules in the upstream wired switch were improperly updated, sending incoming packets to the original AP.</p><p>Instead, our admins might simply ask NetSight: "Show me all packet histories for packets to the client when the handover occurred." Each history would have shown a packet going to the wrong AP along with the upstream flow table state that caused the error, enabling an immediate diagnosis.</p><p>This example shows how just one packet history can single-handedly confirm or disprove a hypothesis about a network problem, by showing events that actually transpired in the network, along with all relevant state. Access to the stream of all packet histories enables diagnostics that would otherwise be impractical, time-consuming, or impossible for a network administrator using conventional tools.</p><p>Challenges. Generating, archiving, and querying packet histories in operational networks requires:</p><p>(1) Path Visibility: we must somehow view and record the paths taken by every packet. (2) State Visibility: we must reconstruct the exact switch state encountered at each packet hop. (3) Modification Visibility: we must know where and how each packet has changed. (4) Collection Scale: all of the above must run at the maximum observed traffic rate. (5) Storage Scale: querying histories requires storing everything, for some time. (6) Processing Scale: query processing should keep up with collection and storage.</p><p>Observing switch states from an external vantage point, by either logging the control messages or querying the switches for their state, will not guarantee precise state-packet correlation. The only place where packets can be correlated with the exact switch state is the data plane itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Opportunities with SDN. SDN offers a path to the correlated visibility we need: logically centralized control provides a natural location to modify forwarding rules, while a common representation of switch state enables us to reason about any changes. Later, in §6, we show how to precisely correlate packets with the state used to forward them. We solve the remaining scale concerns with careful system architecture, aggressive packet header compression, and an optimized implementation. Next, we describe our API for specifying packet histories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The NetSight API</head><p>NetSight exposes an API for applications to specify, receive, and act upon packet histories of interest. NetSight provides a regular-expression-like language-Packet History Filter (PHF)-to express interest in packet histories with specific trajectories, encountered switch state, and header fields. The main function of the NetSight API is: 2 add_filter(packet_history_filter, callback) For every packet history matching the PHF packet_history_filter , the callback function is called along with the complete packet history.</p><p>Postcard Filters. The atomic element in a PHF is the postcard filter (PF). A PF is a filter to match a packet at a hop. Syntactically, a PF is a conjunction of filters on various qualifiers: packet headers, switch ID (known as datapath ID, or dpid), input port, output port, and the switch state encountered by the packet (referenced by a "version" as described in §5). A PF is written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">--bpf [not] &lt;BPF&gt; --dpid [not] &lt;switch ID&gt; --inport [not] &lt;input port&gt; --outport [not]</formula><p>&lt;output port&gt; --version <ref type="bibr">[not]</ref> &lt;version&gt; where, &lt;BPF&gt; is a Berkeley Packet Filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30]</ref> expression. The nots are optional and negate matches. A PF must have at least one of the above qualifiers. For example, a PF for a packet with source IP A, entering switch S at any input port other than port P is written as: --bpf "ip src A" --dpid S --inport not P.</p><p>Packet History Filter Examples. A PHF is a regular expression built with PFs, where each PF is enclosed within double braces. The following sample PHFs use X and Y as PFs to match packets that:</p><p>• start at X: ^{{X}} </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Applications</head><p>The ability to specify and receive packet histories of interest enables new network-diagnosis applications. This section demonstrates the utility of the NetSight API by presenting the four applications we built upon it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">ndb: Interactive Network Debugger</head><p>The original motivating application for NetSight is ndb, an interactive network debugger. The goal of ndb is to provide interactive debugging features for networks, analogous to those provided by gdb for software programs. Using ndb, network application developers can set PHFs on errant network behavior. Whenever these occur, the returned packet histories will contain the sequence of switch forwarding events that led to the errant behavior, helping to diagnose common bugs like the following:</p><p>Reachability Error: Suppose host A is unable to reach host B. Using ndb, the developer would use a PHF to specify packets from A destined for B that never reach the intended final hop: ^{{--bpf "ip src A and dst B" --dpid X --inport p1}}[^{{--dpid Y --outport p2}}]*$ where, (X, p1) and (Y, p2) are the (switch, port) tuples at which hosts A and B are attached. Recall that the regular expression '^X' matches any string that starts with character X, but ' <ref type="bibr">[^X]</ref>' matches any character except 'X'. Thus, the above PHF matches all packet histories with (source,destination)-IP addresses (A,B) that start at (X,p1) but never traverse (Y,p2).</p><p>Race condition: A controller may insert new flow entries on multiple switches in response to network events such as link failures or new flow arrivals. If a controller's flow entry insertions are delayed, packets can get dropped, or the controller can get spurious 'packet-in' notifications. To query such events, NetSight inserts a forwarding rule at the lowest priority in all switches at switch initialization time. This rule generates postcards and performs the default action (by sending to either outport NULL that would drop the packet, or to outport CONTROLLER that would send the packet to the controller). Since this rule is hit only when there is no other matching flow entry, the following PHF captures such events, by matching on packet histories that do not match any flow entry at switch X: {{--dpid X --outport NULL}}$ Incorrect packet modification: Networks with many nodes and rules can make it difficult to see where and why errant packet modifications occurred. Packets reaching the destination with unexpected headers can be captured by the following PHF: ^{{--bpf "BPF1"}}.*{{--bpf "BPF2"}}$ Where BPF1 matches the packet when it enters the network and BPF2 matches the modified packet when it reached the destination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">netwatch: Live Invariant Monitor</head><p>The second application is netwatch, a live network invariant monitor. netwatch allows the operator to specify desired network behavior in the form of invariants, and triggers alarms whenever a packet violates any invariant (e.g., freedom from traffic loops). netwatch is a library of invariants written using PHFs to match packets that violate those invariants. Once PHFs are pushed to NetSight, the callback returns the packet history that violated the invariant(s). The callback not only notifies the operator of an invariant violation, but the PHF provides useful context around why it happened. netwatch currently supports the following network invariants:</p><p>Isolation: Hosts in group A should not be able to communicate with hosts in group B. Raise an alarm whenever this condition is violated. The function isolation(a_host_set, b_host_set, topo) pushes down two PHFs: ^{{ GroupA }}.*{{ GroupB }}$ ^{{ GroupB }}.*{{ GroupA }}$ GroupA and GroupB can be described by a set of host IP addresses or by network locations (switch, port) of hosts. This PHF matches packets that are routed from GroupA to GroupB.</p><p>Loop Freedom: The network should have no traffic loops. The function loop_freedom() pushes down one PHF: (.).*(\1)</p><p>Waypoint routing: Certain types of traffic should go through specific waypoints. For example, all HTTP traffic should go through the proxy, or guest traffic should go through the IDS and Firewall. The function waypoint_routing( traffic_class, waypoint_id) installs a PHF of the form: {{--bpf "traffic_class" --dpid not "waypoint_id"}}{{--dpid not "waypoint_id "}}*$ This PHF catches packet histories of packets that belong to traffic_class and never go through the specified waypoint.</p><p>Max-path-length: No path should ever exceed a specified maximum length, such as the diameter of the network. The function max_path_length(n) installs a PHF of the form: .{n+1} This PHF catches all paths whose lengths exceed n.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">netshark: Network-wide Path-Aware Packet Logger</head><p>The third application is netshark, a wireshark-like application that enables users to set filters on the entire history of packets, including their paths and header values at each hop. For example, a user could look for all HTTP packets with src IP A and dst IP B arriving at (switch X, port p) that have also traversed through switch Y. netshark accepts PHFs from the user, returns the collected packet histories matching the query, and includes a wireshark dissector to analyze the results. The user can then view properties of a packet at a hop (packet header values, switch ID, input port, output port, and matched flow table version) as well as properties of the packet history to which it belongs (path, path length, etc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">nprof: Hierarchical Network Profiler</head><p>The fourth application is nprof, a hierarchical network profiler. The goal of nprof is to 'profile' any collection of network links to understand the traffic characteristics and routing decisions that contribute to link utilization. For example, to profile a particular link, nprof first pushes a PHF specifying the link of interest: {{--dpid X --outport p}} nprof combines the resulting packet histories with the topology information to provide a live hierarchical profile, showing which switches are sourcing traffic to the link, and how much. The profile tree can be further expanded to show which particular flow entries in those switches are responsible. nprof can be used to not only identify end hosts (or applications) that are congesting links of interest, but also identify how a subset of traffic is being routed across the network. This information can suggest better ways to distribute traffic in the network, or show packet headers that cause uneven load distributions on routing mechanisms such as equalcost or weighted-cost multi-path.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">How NetSight Works</head><p>In this section, we present NetSight, a platform to realize the collection, storage, and filtering of all packet histories, upon which one can build a range of applications to troubleshoot networks.</p><p>The astute reader is likely to doubt the scalability of any system that attempts to store every header traversing a network, along with its corresponding path, state, and modifications, as well as apply complex filters. This is a lot of data to forward, let alone process and archive.</p><p>Hence, NetSight is designed from the beginning to scale out and see linear improvements with increasing numbers of servers. The design implements all software processing, such as table lookups, compression operations, and querying, in ways that are simple enough to enable hardware implementations. As an existence proof that such a system is indeed feasible, the implementation described in §6 and evaluated in §7 can perform all packet history process-  ing and storage steps for a moderately-sized network like the Stanford University backbone network on a single server. For networks with higher aggregate bandwidths, processing capabilities increase linearly with the number of servers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">NetSight Philosophy</head><p>NetSight assembles packet histories using postcards, event records sent out whenever a packet traverses a switch. This approach decouples the fate of the postcard from the original packet, helping to troubleshoot packets lost down the road, unlike approaches that append to the original packet. Each postcard contains the packet header, switch ID, output port, and current version of the switch state. Combining topology information with the postcards generated by a packet, we can reconstruct the complete packet history: the exact path taken by the packet along with the state and header modifications encountered by it at each hop along the path.</p><p>We first explain how NetSight works in the common case, where: (1) the network does not drop postcards, (2) the network does not modify packets, and (3) packets are all unicast. Then, in §5.4, we show how NetSight handles these edge cases. NetSight applications issue PHF-based triggers and queries to the coordinator, which then returns a stream or batch of matching packet histories. The coordinator sets up the transmission of postcards from switches to NetSight servers and the transmission of state change records from the network control plane to the coordinator. Finally, the coordi-  nator performs periodic liveness checks, broadcasts queries and triggers, and communicates topology information for the workers to use when assembling packet histories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">System Architecture</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Life Of a Postcard</head><p>NetSight turns postcards into packet histories. To explain this process, we now follow the steps performed inside a NetSight server, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>Postcard Generation. Goal: record all information relevant to a forwarding event and send for analysis. As a packet enters a switch, the switch creates a postcard by duplicating the packet, truncating it to the minimum packet size, marking it with relevant state, and forwarding it to a NetSight server. The marked state includes the switch ID, the output port to which this packet is about to be forwarded, and a version ID representing the exact state of this switch when the packet was forwarded. The original packet remains untouched and continues on its way. Switches today already perform similar packet duplication actions to divert packets for monitoring (e.g. RSPAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> and sFlow). Postcard generation should be much faster than normal packet forwarding, because it does not require any expensive IP lookups. It requires encapsulating the packet to a known port and duplicating the packet output; both of these are cheap operations relative to typical IP lookups. Newer switches <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref> also support hardware-accelerated encapsulation for tunneling traffic at line-rate (e.g., MPLS, GRE, VXLAN, etc.).</p><p>Postcard Collection. Goal: to send all postcards for a packet to one server, so that its packet history can be assembled. In order to reconstruct packet histories, NetSight needs to collect all postcards corresponding to a single packet at a single server. To scale processing, NetSight needs to ensure that these groups of postcards are load balanced across servers. NetSight achieves this by shuffling postcards between NetSight servers, using a hash on the flow ID (5-tuple) to ensure postcard locality.</p><p>Postcard shuffling is batched into time-based "rounds." At the end of a round, servers send postcards collected during the round to their final destination, where the corresponding packet histories can be assembled and archived. This stage provides an opportunity to compress postcard data before shuffling, by exploiting the redundancy of header values, both within a flow, and between flows. Section 6 details NetSight's fast network-specific compression technique to reduce network bandwidth usage.</p><p>History Assembly. Goal: to assemble packet histories from out-of-order postcards. Packet histories must be ordered, but postcards can arrive out-of-order due to varying propagation and queuing delays from switches to NetSight servers. NetSight uses topology information, rather than fine-grained timestamps, to place postcards in order.</p><p>When a NetSight server has received the complete round of postcards from every other server, it decompresses and merges each one into the Path Table, a data structure that helps combine all postcards for a single packet into a group. To identify all postcards corresponding to a packet, NetSight combines immutable header fields such as IP ID, fragment offset, and TCP sequence number fields into a "packet ID," which uniquely identifies a packet within a flow. To evaluate the strategy of using immutable header fields to identify packets, we analyzed a 400k-packet trace of enterprise packet headers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28]</ref>. Nearly 11.3% of packets were indistinguishable from at least one other packet within a one-second time window. On closer inspection, we found that these were mostly UDP packets with IPID 0 generated by an NFS server. Ignoring these UDP packets removed all IP packet ambiguity, leaving only seven ambiguous ARPs. This initial analysis suggests that most of the packets have enough entropy in their header fields to be uniquely identified. The Path <ref type="table">Table is simply a  hash table indexed by</ref>  The NetSight server extracts these postcard groups, one-at-a-time, to assemble them into packet histories. For each group, NetSight then performs a topological sort, using switch IDs and output ports, along with topology data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3</ref> The resulting sorted list of postcards is the packet history.</p><p>Filter triggers. Goal: to immediately notify applications of fresh packet histories matching a preinstalled PHF. Once the packet history is assembled, NetSight matches it against any "live" PHFs pre-installed by applications such as netwatch, and immediately triggers notifications back to the application on a successful match.</p><p>History archival. Goal: to efficiently store the full set of packet histories. Next, the stream of packet histories generated in each round is written to a file. NetSight compresses these records using the same compression algorithm that is used before the shuffle phase to exploit redundancy between postcards of a packet and between packets of a flow.</p><p>Historical queries. Goal: to enable applications to issue PHF queries against archived packet histories. When an application issues a historical PHF query to a specified time region, that query runs in parallel on all NetSight servers. Compression helps to improve effective disk throughput here, and hence reduces query completion times. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Relaxing the Assumptions</head><p>We now describe how NetSight handles corner cases.</p><p>Dropped Postcards. When postcard drops occur (e.g., due to congestion), packet histories become incomplete, causing NetSight to return errantly matched histories as well as to miss histories that should have matched the installed PHFs. NetSight delegates the responsibility for handling these events to apps. For example, ndb returns partial his-tories to the user, who can often resolve the omission by using the topology information and filling the missing postcards. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5</ref> Out-of-band control links and highest-priority queues for postcards can help to minimize postcard drops.</p><p>Non-unicast Packets. For broadcast and multicast traffic, NetSight returns packet histories as directed graphs, rather than lists. For loops, NetSight returns the packet history with an arbitrary starting point and marks it as a loop.</p><p>Modified Packets. When Network Address Translation (NAT) boxes modify the header fields in the flow key, the postcards for one packet may arrive at different NetSight servers, preventing complete packet history assembly. Using immutable headers or hashes of packet contents in the shuffle phase would ensure that all postcards for one packet arrive at the same server. 6 However, with such keys, packet histories of packets belonging to a single flow will be evenly spread among servers, reducing opportunities for storage compression: each of n servers will see packet histories of 1/n-th of the packets of each flow.</p><p>Adding a second shuffle stage can ensure both correctness and storage efficiency. In the first stage, packet histories are shuffled for assembly using their packet ID, while in the second stage, they are shuffled for storage using a hash of the 5-tuple flow key of their first packet. The reduced storage comes at a cost of additional network traffic and processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">NetSight Implementation</head><p>Our NetSight implementation has two processes: one interposes between an OpenFlow controller and its switches to record configuration changes, while another does all postcard and history processing. To verify that it operates correctly on physical switches, we ran it on a chain topology of 6 NEC IP8800 switches <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31]</ref>. To verify that it ran with unmodified controllers, we tested it on the Mininet emulation environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref> with multiple controllers (OpenFlow reference, NOX <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref>, POX <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35]</ref>, RipL-POX <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[36]</ref>) on multiple topologies (chains, trees, and fat trees). This section describes the individual pieces of our prototype, which implements all postcard and history processing in C++ and implements the control channel proxy in Python.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Postcard Generation</head><p>The NetSight prototype is for SDN, leveraging the fact that network state changes are coordinated by a controller. This provides an ideal place to monitor and intercept switch configuration changes. It uses a transparent proxy called the flow table state recorder (recorder for short) that sits on the control path between the controller and OpenFlow switches.</p><p>When a controller modifies flow tables on a switch, the recorder intercepts the message and stores it in a database. For each OpenFlow rule sent by the controller to the switch, the recorder appends new actions to generate a postcard for each packet matching the rule in addition to the controller-specified forwarding.</p><p>Specifically, the actions create a copy of the packet and tag it with the switch ID, 7 the output port, and a version number for the matching flow entry. The version number is simply a counter that is incremented for every flow modification message. The tag values overwrite the original destination MAC address (the original packet header is otherwise unchanged). Once assembled, postcards are sent to a NetSight server over a separate VLAN. Postcard forwarding can be handled out-of-band via a separate network, or in-band over the regular network; both methods are supported. In the in-band mode, switches recognize postcards using a special VLAN tag to avoid generating postcards for postcards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Compression</head><p>NetSight compresses postcards in two places: (1) before shuffling them to servers, and (2) before archiving assembled packet histories to disk. While we can use off-the-shelf compression algorithms (such as LZMA) to compress the stream of packets, we can do better by leveraging the structure in packet headers and the fact that all the packets in a flow-identified by the 5-tuple flow id (srcip, dstip, srcport, dstport, protocol)-look similar.</p><p>NetSight compresses packets by computing diffs between successive packets in the same stream. A diff is a (Header,Value) pair, where Header uniquely identifies the field that changed and Value is its new value. Certain fields (e.g. IPID and TCP Sequence numbers) compress better if we just store the successive deltas. Compression works as follows: the first packet of each flow is stored verbatim. Subsequent packets are only encoded as the (Header,Value) tuples that change, with a backreference to the previous packet in the same stream. Finally, NetSight pipes the stream of encoded diffs through a standard fast compression algorithm (e.g. gzip at level 1). Our compression algorithm is a gen-eralization of Van Jacobson's compression of TCP packets over slow links <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">PHF Matching</head><p>The PHF matching engine in NetSight is based on the RE1 regex engine <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> and uses the Linux x86 BPF compiler <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> to match packet headers against BPF filters. RE1 compiles a subset (concatenation, alternation and the Kleene star) of regular expressions into byte codes. This byte code implements a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton which RE1 executes on an input string. In RE1, character matches trigger state machine transitions; we modify RE1 and "overload" the character equality check to match postcards against postcard filters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Test Deployment Anecdote</head><p>NetSight helped to uncover a subtle bug during our initial test deployment. While connectivity between hosts seemed normal, the packet histories returned by ndb for packets that should have passed through a particular switch were consistently returned as two partial paths on either side of the switch. These packet histories provided all the context our administrator needed to immediately diagnose the problem: due to a misconfiguration, the switch was behaving like an unmanaged layer-2 switch, rather than an OpenFlow switch as we intended.</p><p>With no apparent connectivity issues, this bug would have gone unnoticed, and might have manifested later in a much less benign form, as forwarding loops or security policy violations. This unexpected debugging experience further highlights the power of packet histories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Evaluation</head><p>This section quantifies the performance of the serverside mechanisms that comprise NetSight, to investigate the feasibility of collecting and storing every packet history. From measurements of each step, including compression, assembly, and filtering, we can determine the data rate that a single core can handle. For switch-side mechanisms and scaling them, skip to §8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Compression</head><p>NetSight compresses postcards before the shuffle phase to reduce network bandwidth, then compresses packet histories again during the archival phase to reduce storage costs. We investigate three questions:</p><p>Compression: how tightly can NetSight compress packet headers, and how does this compare to offthe-shelf options? Traces. While we do not have a hardware implementation of the compression techniques, we answer the performance questions using thirteen packet capture (pcap) data sets: one from a university enterprise network (UNIV), two from university data centers (DCs), and nine from a WAN. We preprocessed all traces and removed all non-IPv4, non-TCP and non-UDP packets, then stripped packet headers beyond the layer 4 TCP header, which accounted for less than 1% of all traffic. UNIV is the largest trace, containing 31 GB of packet headers collected over an hour on a weekday afternoon. The average flow size over the duration of this trace is 76 packets. The data center traces DC1 and DC2 have average flow sizes of about 29 and 333 packets per flow respectively. However, in the WAN traces, we observed that flows, on average, have less than 3 packets over the duration of the trace. We do not know why; however, this extreme point stresses the efficiency of the compression algorithm.</p><p>The UNIV trace contains packets seen at one core router connecting Clemson University to the Internet. The data center traces-DC1 and DC2-are from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref> whose IP addresses were anonymized using SHA1 hash. And finally, each WAN trace (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[43]</ref>) accounts for a minute of packet data collected by a hardware packet capture device. IP addresses in this trace are anonymized using a CryptoPan prefixpreserving anonymization.</p><p>Storage vs CPU costs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> answers many of our performance questions, showing the tradeoff between compression storage costs and CPU costs, for different traces and compression methods. This graph compares four candidate methods, listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: (a) PCAP: the uncompressed list packet headers, (b) gzip compression directly on the pcap file, (c) NS: the adaptation of Van Jacobson's compression algorithm, (d) NS+GZ: output of (c) followed by gzip compression (level 1, fastest). Each one is lossless with respect to headers; they recover all header fields and timestamps and maintain the packet ordering.</p><p>We find that all candidates reduce storage relative to PCAP files, by up to 4x, and as expected, their CPU costs vary. GZ, an off-the-shelf option, compresses well, but has a higher CPU cost than both NS and NS+GZ, which leverage knowledge of packet formats in their compression. NetSight uses NS+GZ, because for every trace, it compresses better than pure GZ, at a reasonably low CPU cost.</p><p>We also find that the compressed sizes depend heavily on the average flow size of the trace. Most of the benefits come from storing differences between successive packets of a flow, and a smaller average flow size reduces opportunities to compress. We see this in the WAN traces, which have shorter flows and compress less. Most of the flow entropy is in a few fields such as IP identification, IP checksums and TCP checksums, and the cost of storing diffs for these fields is much lower than the cost of storing a whole packet header.</p><p>To put these speeds in perspective, consider our most challenging scenario, NS+GZ in the WAN, shown by the blue stars. The average process time per packet is 3.5µs, meaning that one of the many cores in a modern CPU can process 285K postcards/sec. Assuming an average packet size of 600 bytes, this translates to about 1.37 Gb/s of network traffic, and this number scales linearly with the number of cores. Moreover, the storage cost (for postcards) is about 6.84 MB/s; a 1 TB disk array can store all <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: Packet compression quality for NS+GZ as a function of packets seen in the trace. In our traces from three operating environments, we find that NetSight quickly benefits from compression after processing a few 100s of thousands of packets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scenario</head><p>Enterprise WAN Data Center CPU cost 0.725µs 0.434µs 0.585µs per packet postcards for an entire day. The actual duration for which postcards need to be stored depends on the scenario and the organizational needs. For example, to troubleshoot routine network crashes whose symptoms are usually instantly visible, storing a day or two worth of postcards might suffice. On the other hand, to troubleshoot security breaches, whose effects might show up much later, postcards might have to be stored for a longer period, say a week. Most of this storage cost goes into storing the first packet of a flow; as the number of packets per flow increases (e.g. in datacenter traces), the storage costs reduce further.</p><p>Duration. A key parameter for NetSight is the round length. Longer rounds present more opportunities for postcard compression, but increase the delay until the applications see matching packet histories. Smaller rounds reduce the size of the hash table used to store flow keys in NS compression, speeding up software implementations and making hardware implementations easier. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows packet compression performance as a function of the number of packets in a round. This graph suggests that short rounds of 1000 packets see many of the compression benefits, while long rounds of 1M postcards maximize them. On most lightly loaded 10Gb/s links, a 1M postcard round translates to about a second.</p><p>Decompression Speed. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> shows NS+GZ decompression costs for one trace from each of the environments. In every case, NS+GZ decompression is significantly faster than compression. These numbers underrepresent the achievable per-postcard  latencies, because the implementation loads the entire set of first packets and timestamps into memory before iterating through the list of diff records. As with compression, a small round timer would improve cache locality and use less memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Packet History Assembly</head><p>At the end of the shuffle phase, each NetSight server assembles packet histories by topologically sorting received postcards, which may have arrived out-oforder. We measure the speed of our history assembly module written in C++. Topological sorting is fast -it runs in O(p), where p is the number of postcards in the packet history, and typically, p will be small. For typical packet history lengths (2 to 8 hops long in each of the networks we observed) history assembly takes less than 100 nanoseconds. In other words, a single NetSight server can assemble more than 10 million packet histories per second per core.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Triggering and Query Processing</head><p>NetSight needs to match assembled packet histories against PHFs, either on a live stream of packet histories or on an archive. In this section, we measure the speed of packet history matching using both microbenchmarks and a macrobenchmark suite, looking for where matching might be slowest. The PHF match latency depends on (1) the length of the packet history, (2) the size and type of the PHF, and (3) whether the packet history matches against the PHF.</p><p>Microbenchmarks. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 6</ref> shows the performance of our PHF implementation for sample PHFs of varying size on packet histories of varying length. The sample PHFs are of the type .*X, .*X.*, X.*X, and X.*X.*X, where each X is a postcard filter and contains filters on packet headers (BPF), switch ID, and input ports. We match a large number of packet histories against each PHF and calculate the average latency per match. In order to avoid any datacaching effects, we read the packet histories from a 6GB file, and we ignore the I/O latency incurred while reading packet histories from the disk. The dashed lines show the latency when the packet history matches the PHF ("match"), while the solid lines show the latency when the packet history does match the PHF ("no-match"). We see that the "match" latencies are typically smaller than the corresponding "non-match" latencies, since the code can return as soon as a match is detected. We also see that the match latency increases with the number of PFs in the PHF as well as the length of the packet history. Importantly, the region of interest is the bottom left corner -packet histories of length 2 to 8. Here, the match latency is low: a few hundred nanoseconds.</p><p>Macrobenchmarks. The UNIV trace was captured at the core router connecting two large datacenters and 150 buildings to the Internet. We reconstruct packet histories for packets in this trace using topology and subnet information. Then we run a suite of 28 benchmark PHF queries which include filters on specific hosts, locations (datacenter, campus and Internet), paths between locations, and headers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref> shows the average PHF match time (on a single CPU core) for a representative set of queries on hosts, subnets (campus), and paths (dc hdr-campus hdr). Most matches execute fast (&lt;300ns/match); the most expensive ones (900ns/-match) are complex BPF queries that contain a predictate on 24 subnets.</p><p>The above results show that even an unoptimized single-threaded implementation of PHF matching can achieve high throughput. In addition, PHF matching is embarrassingly parallel: each packet history can be matched against a PHF independent of all other packet histories, enabling linear multi-core scalability. A future optimized implementation can also perform the matching directly on compressed archives of packet histories, rather than on each individual packet history.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.4">Provisioning Scenario</head><p>At the beginning of this paper, we suggested a set of questions, each of which maps to a filter in NetSight. With performance numbers for each piece of NetSight, we can estimate the traffic rate it can handle to answer those questions.</p><p>Adding up the end-to-end processing costs in NetSight -compressing, decompressing, assembling, and filtering packets -yields a per-core throughput of 240K postcards/second. With five hops on the typical path and 1000-byte packets, a single 16-core server, available for under $2000, can handle 6.1 Gb/s of network traffic. This is approximately the average rate of the transit traffic in our campus backbone. To handle the peak, a few additional servers would suffice, and as the network grows, the administrator can add servers knowing that NetSight will scale to handle the added demand.</p><p>The key takeaway is that NetSight is able to handle the load from an entire campus backbone with 20,000 users, with a small number of servers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Scaling NetSight</head><p>If we do not compress postcards before sending them over the network, we need to send them each as a min-sized packet. We can calculate the bandwidth cost as a fraction of the data traffic as: cost = postcard packet size avg packet size × avg number of hops.</p><p>The bandwidth cost is inversely proportional to the average packet size in the network.</p><p>For example, consider our university campus backbone with 14 internal routers connected by 10Gb/s links, two Internet-facing routers, a network diameter of 5 hops, and an average packet size of 1031 bytes. If we assume postcards are minimum-sized Ethernet packets, they increase traffic by 64B 1031B × 5(hops) = 31%. 8 The average aggregate utilization in our university backbone is about 5.9Gb/s, for which postcard traffic adds 1.8Gb/s. Adding together the peak traffic seen at each campus router, we get 25Gb/s of packet data, which will generate 7.8Gb/s of postcard traffic,  For a low-utilization network, especially test networks or production networks in the bring-up phase, these bandwidth costs may be acceptable for the debugging functionality NetSight provides. But for a live network with more hops, smaller packets, or higher utilization, our NetSight may consume too much network bandwidth. To scale NetSight to a large data center or an enterprise, we present two design modifications that reduce network bandwidth by moving some of the processing into the switches and end hosts, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NetSight-SwitchAssist</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypervisors</head><p>NetSight-SwitchAssist, shown in the middle of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, uses additional logic in the switches to locally implement the Postcard Stage with compression, thus avoiding the extra network capacity needed to transport uncompressed postcards to the NetSight servers in minimum-size packets. Since switches send compressed aggregates of postcards to NetSight servers (rather than individual uncompressed postcards), the bandwidth requirement diminishes. For example, with a size of 15 bytes per compressed postcard (as shown in §7), the bandwidth requirement reduces from 31% to 7%.</p><p>NetSight-HostAssist, shown at the bottom of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 8</ref>, is suited for environments where end hosts can be modified. This design reduces postcard traffic by using a thin shim layer at each end host (e.g. in a software switch such as Open vSwitch <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref>) to tag packets to help switches succinctly describe postcards. The shim tags each outgoing packet with a sequentially-incrementing globally-unique packet ID and locally stores the mapping between the ID and the packet header. When a switch receives a packet, it extracts the tag and generates a mini-postcard that contains only the packet ID, the flow table state and the input/output ports. This state is appended to a hash table entry keyed by the source address of this packet. Since a packet ID is valid only to a particular host, the shim can use fewer bytes (e.g. 4 bytes) to uniquely identify a packet. When enough bytes accumulate, the switch dispatches the hash entry (a list of packet IDs and state) to the source. At the end of a round, the hosts locally assemble and archive the packet history.</p><p>If on average, it takes 15 bytes per packet to store compressed headers at the VM hosts ( §7), and 6 bytes per mini-postcard, the bandwidth overhead to collect postcards in the network reduces to 3%. This number contrasts with 31% overhead when postcards are collected naively. Since each end host stores packet histories for its own traffic, the mechanism scales with the number of hosts. If 3% is still unacceptable, then NetSight may be deployed for a subset of packets or a subset of switches. However, both of these options are qualitatively different; either NetSight cannot guarantee that a requested packet history will be available when ignoring some packets, or NetSight cannot guarantee that each generated packet history will represent a packet's complete path when not enabled network-wide.</p><p>To put things in perspective, while NetSight requires firmware modifications to expose existing hardware functionality, NetSight-SwitchAssist and NetSight-HostAssist require hardware modifications in the switches. If our campus network ( §7.4) were to get upgraded to NetSight-SwitchAssist, one of the expensive compression steps would go away and yield a traffic processing rate of 7.3 Gb/s per server. Adding NetSight-HostAssist would yield a rate of 55 Gb/s per server, because mini-postcards require no compression or decompression. The processing costs are heavily dominated by compression, and reducing these costs seems like a worthwhile future direction to improve NetSight.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Summary</head><p>Networks are inherently distributed, with highly concurrent data-plane and control-plane events, and they move data at aggregate rates greater than any single server can process. These factors make it challenging to pause or "single-step" a network, and none of our network diagnosis tools try to connect packet events to control events. As a result, administrators find it hard to construct a packet's perspective of its forwarding journey, despite the value for diagnosing problems.</p><p>NetSight addresses these challenges to improve network visibility in operational networks, by leveraging SDN to first gain visibility into forwarding events, and then tackling performance concerns with a scale-out system architecture, aggressive packet header compression, and carefully optimized C++ code. The surprising result is the feasibility and practicality of collecting and storing complete packet histories for all traffic on moderate-size networks.</p><p>Furthermore, NetSight demonstrates that given access to a network's complete packet histories, one can implement a number of compelling new applications. Atop the NetSight Packet History Filter (PHF) API, we implemented four applications-a network debugger, invariant monitor, packet logger, and hierarchical network profiler-none of which required more than 200 lines of code. These tools manifested their utility immediately, when a single, incompletely assembled packet history revealed a switch configuration error within minutes of our first test deployment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc>end at X: {{X}}$ • go through X: {{X}} • go through X, and later Y: {{X}}.*{{Y}} • start at X, never reach Y: ^{{X}}[^{{Y}}]*$ • experience a loop: (.).*(\1)</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> The other important function is delete_filter.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> In the current implementation the topology data needs to be externally fed into NetSight. Alternatively, with the SDN implementation described in §6, the proxy can dynamically learn the topology. 4 Ideally the filesystem is log-structured, to restore individual rounds at the full disk throughput, with minimal seeking [37].</note>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> These can indicate an unexpected switch configuration too, as we saw the first time using NetSight on a network ( §6.4). 6 That is, if middleboxes don&apos;t mess with packet contents.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="7"> To fit into the limited tag space, NetSight uses a locally created &quot;pseudo switch ID&quot; (PSID) and maintains an internal mapping from the 8 B datapath ID to the PSID.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="8"> If we overcome the min-size requirement by aggregating the 40 byte postcards into larger packets before sending them, the bandwidth overhead reduces to 19%.</note>
