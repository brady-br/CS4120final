			<abstract>
				<p>Despite an extensive anti-phishing ecosystem, phishing attacks continue to capitalize on gaps in detection to reach a signiicant volume of daily victims. In this paper, we isolate and identify these detection gaps by measuring the end-to-end life cycle of large-scale phishing attacks. We develop a unique framework-Golden Hour-that allows us to passively measure victim traac to phishing pages while proactively protecting tens of thousands of accounts in the process. Over a one year period, our network monitor recorded 4.8 million victims who visited phishing pages, excluding crawler traac. We use these events and related data sources to dissect phishing campaigns: from the time they rst come online, to email distribution , to visitor traac, to ecosystem detection, and nally to account compromise. We nd the average campaign from start to the last victim takes just 21 hours. At least 7.42% of visitors supply their credentials and ultimately experience a compromise and subsequent fraudulent transaction. Furthermore, a small collection of highly successful campaigns are responsible for 89.13% of victims. Based on our ndings, we outline potential opportunities to respond to these sophisticated attacks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Phishing attacks target millions of Internet users each year, resulting in sensitive data exposures, nancial fraud, and identity theft <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>. These attacks also harm the reputation of targeted brands as well as incur collateral damage to the broader ecosystem and user trust. Modern phishing attacks fall into two general categories: spearphishing, where attackers target speciic high-value individuals or groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, and large scale attacks, where attackers target a broad range of potential victims to proot through volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. In this work, we focus on the latter.</p><p>Prior research has shown that large scale phishing lures have a low click-through rate (5-8%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> and that the likelihood that targeted users will hand over credentials to attackers is similarly low (9%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Yet, the volume of observed phishing attacks shows no signs of subsiding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Furthermore, social engineering techniques such as phishing remain one of the primary stepping stones to even more harmful scams <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>In an adversarial race-fueled in part by the underground economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>-phishers collectively seek to stay one step ahead of the security community through a myriad of evasion techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. Recent work has shown how cloaking and related strategies signiicantly delay browser-based phishing detection and warnings-a defense layer adopted by every major browser <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>. However, the implications of such delays on the success of each attack are not yet well-understood, nor is the precise window of opportunity available to attackers between the launch and detection of their phishing websites.</p><p>In this paper, we present a longitudinal, end-to-end analysis of the progression of modern phishing attacks, from the time of deployment to the time a victim's account is compromised. Our study relies on a key observation: despite cloaking and related evasive eeorts, a substantial proportion of phishing pages make requests for web resources (e.g., images and scripts) hosted by third-parties, including the websites that attackers impersonate. Based on this insight, we collaborate with one of the most-targeted nancial services brands in the current ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref> to develop and deploy a re-usable framework to meaningfully analyze victim traac to live phishing pages.</p><p>We start by analyzing 404,628 distinct phishing URLs in our traac dataset to gain an understanding of the aggregate volume and timing of key events within the life cycle of phishing attacks. Next, we correlate the traac with the original phishing email lures to map the distribution phase of the attacks. Finally, we investigate the timing and success rates of attackers' monetization eeorts based on the subsequent account compromise and fraudulent transactions-of the same victims-at a major nancial services provider. We show that the data sampled by our approach provides visibility into 39.1% of all known phishing hostnames which targeted the same brand during our observation period.</p><p>We nd that the average phishing attack spans 21 hours between the rst and last victim visit, and that the detection of each attack by anti-phishing entities occurs on average nine hours after the rst victim visit. Once detected, a further seven hours elapse prior to peak mitigation by browser-based warnings. This gap constitutes the "golden hours" during which attackers achieve a signiicant return-on-investment from their attacks that might otherwise be mitigated. Alarmingly, 37.73% of all victim traac within our dataset took place after attack detection, and at least 7.42% of all targeted victims suuer subsequent fraud.</p><p>Our approach allows us to identify characteristics of particularly successful phishing attacks. We found that the top 10% largest attacks in our dataset accounted for 89.13% of targeted victims and that these attacks proved capable of eeectively defeating the ecosystem's mitigations in the long term. Phishing campaigns would remain online for as long as nine months while deceiving tens of thousands of victims in the processusing sophisticated, but oo-the-shelf phishing kits on a single compromised domain name. As a result, we propose a practical methodology for organizations targeted by phishing to proactively mitigate similar attacks, and we deploy our approach to secure the aaected victims' accounts in our study.</p><p>Our work motivates the expansion of collaborative, defense-in-depth anti-phishing approaches as a means to cope with phishers' evasion techniques and increasing sophistication. It underscores the importance of not only making improvements to existing ecosystem defenses such as browser-based detection, but also more widely adapting proactive mitigations like those that we propose. The contributions of our work are as follows:</p><p>• A longitudinal measurement study of the end-to-end life cycle of real phishing attacks representative of the modern anti-phishing ecosystem.</p><p>• A framework for the proactive detection and mitigation of phishing websites that embed external resources.</p><p>• Security recommendations to address the limitations within the current anti-phishing ecosystem based on our analysis of highly successful phishing attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>Phishing is a type of attack through which malicious actors (i.e., phishers) leverage social engineering to trick victims into unknowingly disclosing sensitive information such as account credentials, personal data, or nancial details <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Typically, victims are lured to a fraudulent website that impersonates a well-known brand solely for the purpose of harvesting such information. Attackers then use the stolen information for their own gain, either directly or through monetization services prevalent in underground marketplaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>. In recent years, criminals have shown no signs of slowing down their phishing attacks; the increased diiculty of driveby downloads and exploits has given a resurgence to large attacks grounded in social engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>. As such, phishing continues to evolve in sophistication to adapt to best practices within the broader Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>. When used by criminals, credentials obtained through phishing have proved to work the most reliably due to the broad range of other identifying information obtainable through phishing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>. Subsequent account compromise occurs at scale and accounts for substantial monetary damage to both users and businesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Phishing Websites and Phishing Kits</head><p>Large scale phishing attacks consist of three main phases. First, an attacker launches a deceptive website that spoofs the lookand-feel of a legitimate website (e.g., of a prominent brand). Thereafter, the attacker sends messages to potential victims (e.g., via spam email) with a link to the phishing website. Social engineering techniques often play an important role in these messages; they may lure users by conveying a sense of urgency and a need for action, such as correcting a billing error or securing a ((ctitiously) compromised account <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. If the lure successfully deceives the victim <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>, the victim submits the sensitive information requested by the attacker. The phishing website may also record metadata about the user, such as the user's IP address or language from the HTTP request. Finally, the attacker downloads the stolen information from the phishing page or associated drop box <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Beyond email, attackers also rely on social media lures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, spoofed or exploited mobile or cloud applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>, search engine listings, text messages, and phone calls <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65]</ref> in order to reach victims. However, email-based attacks remain dominant within the ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; such attacks enjoy greater scalability thanks in part to the help of underground services that simplify bulk messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63]</ref>. Also, advanced features in phishing kits help phishers deceive their victims and bypass anti-phishing mitigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>; some can even intercept (and thus defeat) multi-factor authentication like SMS in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, the deployment of phishing websites-even those which are technically sophisticated and laden with evasion techniques-has a low barrier to entry, likewise thanks to services in the underground economy. Phishing kits are readily available oo-the-shelf packages that attackers can use to deploy phishing websites without the need for any technical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Such kits are often bundled with exploits which can be used to install the kit on a compromised web server (thus minimizing any cost to the attacker).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Detecting and Mitigating Phishing</head><p>The risk of phishing attacks has given rise to an extensive anti-abuse ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. Multiple layers of defense include email spam classiication lters <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, crimeware and credential drop analytics <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, URL and content classiication and blacklisting <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">76]</ref>, malware and vulnerability scanning by web hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, DNS, domain, and certiicate intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>, user training <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, content take-down <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and direct abuse reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>Browser-based phishing detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>-like Google Safe Browsing or Microsoft Windows Defender-serve a particularly important role due to its scale and always-on nature.</p><p>All major web browsers have phishing detection built-in by default for both desktop and mobile platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>. When a user visits a URL, their browser will make a call to a detection backend (e.g., a URL blacklist or a heuristic classiier) and show a prominent warning if the URL is deemed harmful. This represents a considerable improvement over early decentralized mitigations such as add-on toolbars <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Evasion Techniques</head><p>The longer that phishing websites remain online and are accessible to victims, the more attackers stand to proot. Therefore, modern phishing websites seek to maximize their own longevity through a variety of strategies to remain stealthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>. We provide an overview of key strategies below, and ooer further insight, based on our ndings, in Section 7.1.</p><p>Cloaking: In an eeort to prevent security infrastructure from verifying malicious content, phishing websites with cloaking display benign content or an inconspicuous error message whenever they detect that a web request originates from an anti-phishing crawler <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Cloaking is typically implemented through client-or server-side code which applies lters using attributes such as IP address, geolocation, user agent, session cookies, or browser ngerprints. The presence of cloaking is the norm, rather than the exception, within modern phishing websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>.</p><p>Redirection Links: URLs are the most direct indicators of phishing attacks and are therefore one of the primary data points used by anti-phishing systems. To evade detection, some attackers initially distribute URLs that might appear benign but redirect to diierent landing URLs which may contain deceptive keywords <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Such redirection not only hampers the use of URL heuristics as a detection strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref>, but also makes it diicult to correlate URLs that are part of the same redirection chain in the wild <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. Redirection links themselves may leverage cloaking or frequently change to evade detection, even when pointing to the same phishing landing page.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Measuring the Impact of Phishing</head><p>Meaningfully assessing long-term trends in the volume of phishing attacks has historically proved to be challenging due to a lack of transparency and consistency in the methodology applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Data sources that could be eeectively used for such measurements are spread throughout the ecosystem and typically held closely by their owners. Other data, such as phishing URLs, is more readily available and suitable for classiication or ngerprinting purposes, but not directly coupled with attack volume or impact <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Since 2004, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG)-an industry-wide consortium of key anti-phishing entities-has regularly published summary reports of monthly phishing volume and ecosystem attack trends based on diverse partner data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Although these reports have provided phishing volume gures for over a decade, changes in methodology and data sources over time prevent longitudinal analysis and only enable conclusions such as "phishing continues on a large scale". Research with deeper insight into the progression of phishing attacks has thus far been limited to smaller datasets or isolated scope <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</p><p>Obtaining data relating to the damage caused by phishing attacks (i.e., as a result of account compromise or credential theft) at speciic organizations is even more challenging due to its sensitive nature in terms of both individual victims' and businesses' conndentiality. Additionally, victims themselves have shown a tendency to under-report cybercrime to authorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Aggregate summaries of such damage are thus often extrapolations based on certain assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we discuss our approach to measuring the end-to-end life cycle of phishing websites, from the time of connguration to the time the attack goes ooine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Phishing Attack Stages</head><p>We show an overview of the stages of a typical phishing attack in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Attackers rst obtain infrastructure (A) and congure a phishing website on this infrastructure (B), often by installing a phishing kit. Once the website is operational, attackers begin distributing it to their victims (C) and victims start accessing it (D), as previously discussed in Section 2.1. After this point, the remaining stages are not necessarily consecutive.</p><p>Once detected by anti-phishing infrastructure, the attack will be mitigated by the ecosystem's defenses such as browser-based phishing warnings (E). In an optimal scenario, this mitigation would occur before time D and would prevent all future victim traac. If these conditions are not satissed, victim visits may continue for an extended period, and attackers will proceed to monetize the data stolen by the phishing website through various means (F) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[63]</ref>, which could entail testing stolen credentials against the corresponding platforms, or submitting fraudulent transactions using stolen nancials <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71]</ref>. The original phishing website will eventually go ooine, either as a result of take-down eeorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> or deliberately by attackers (G). Note that malicious infrastructure connguration (A) is outside of the scope of our work, as we focus purely on phishing attacks themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USENIX Association 29th USENIX Security Symposium 363</head><p>Figure 2: Golden Hour framework design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Observations</head><p>As a preliminary step in our study, in June 2018, we manually inspected a sample of live phishing websites shortly after their URLs were submitted to PhishTank <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>, OpenPhish <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>, or the APWG eCrime Exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> (large clearinghouses of phishing URLs). We made two key observations: rst, that phishing websites routinely embed resources (e.g., images, fonts, or JavaScript) hosted on third-party domains, including domains which belong to the organizations being impersonated; and second, that some phishing websites redirect the victim back to the organization's legitimate website after the victim submits their information.</p><p>It thus follows that third parties-including the organizations being targeted and impersonated by phishers-could, with the right methodology, directly track visitor activity on certain phishing websites by inspecting HTTP/HTTPS requests for the aforementioned web resources within their own systems, and by identifying referrals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> from suspicious sources. Such tracking could capture not only victim interaction with the phishing websites, but also visits from attackers themselves as they conngure and test their attacks.</p><p>Moreover, the data could be used to proactively identify phishing URLs and propagate them through the anti-phishing ecosystem. Correlating the data with victim information (e.g., if a visitor's request for a resource on a phishing website has the same session identiier as a prior visit to the organization's legitimate website <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) could help organizations better mitigate attacks by securing any accounts tied to the victims, while simultaneously measuring the eeective damage likely caused by phishing. Lastly, correlating URLs in phishing lures (e.g., email messages) with victim traac to phishing websites can paint a clear picture of the distribution phase of phishing attacks.</p><p>Recent work used a similar approach to identify characteristics of successful email lures and discover the corresponding URLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>. Our analysis of web event data instead focuses on mapping the overall progression of phishing attacks: consequently, we correlate the timing of key events within phishing attacks to a deeper extent, and on a larger scale, than previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. We also consider the success of phishing attacks, and we directly leverage the web event data as an anti-phishing mitigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Data Analysis Framework</head><p>The aforementioned analysis necessitates access to data only available to speciic organizations (i.e., those commonly targeted by phishers or engaged in anti-phishing). We collaborated with one such organization-a major nancial services provider-to develop and deploy a generic framework for processing the relevant data. The Golden Hour framework, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, extracts web tracking events associated with phishing websites for analytical purposes or as a real-time proactive mitigation.</p><p>Our framework is brand-agnostic and could thus realistically be adapted for use by a broad range of organizations that have access to the appropriate data. We start by providing an abstract overview of the framework and then discuss our deployment in Section 4.1. In Section 5, we show that our framework enables insight into phishing attacks during their early golden hours, and that it can eeectively disrupt attacks during or prior to this period.</p><p>In the Golden Hour framework, we rst ingest web events of interest ( 1 ), which can be obtained from raw web traac logs (i.e., requests for images or style elements) or pre-processed data from web trackers or JavaScript web application code. We annotate each ingested event with a timestamp and extract further attributes, such as the IP address, user agent, session identiiers (i.e., from prior requests), referring URL, and the main page URL which was visited. We then take the latter two URL attributes and apply whitelist ltering ( 2 ) to eliminate benign events which would normally be expected to be seen in this context, such as requests to the organization's legitimate website or requests with referrers on approved partner websites. Thereafter, we correlate (by substring matching) the URLs of the remaining events with a recent list of known phishing URLs from additional data sources ( 3 ); this correlation enables the discovery of new phishing URLs which might only share a similar hostname or path with a previously-reported URL, but diier otherwise. It is also possible to apply phishing URL classiication heuristics to identify previously-unknown URLs of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>The event correlation can take place in an online manner, or be deferred, in which case events are archived for later analysis ( 4 ). In both cases, to allow for scalability, a chosen observation window deenes a range of time (i.e., before and after a URL is reported) within which correlations for a given phishing URL are made. Successive reports of the same URL naturally extend the observation window; otherwise, correlations against unnecessary data can be avoided.</p><p>Events that are identiied as phishing are additionally marked for immediate mitigation. Over time, we further reene the archived events ( 5 ) by identifying false positive correlations, noise from automated (i.e., web crawler) traac, and phishing URLs detected at a later point in time, with the use of statistical analysis and external data sources ( 6 ).</p><p>To beneet from our framework's mitigation capabilities, it should ideally be deployed online, on a stream of live (or recent) data during the ingestion stage ( 1 ). However, the framework can also process archived (i.e., historical) event data alone. In the long term, as the anti-phishing ecosystem builds ground truth (i.e., by having access to a vetted list of known phishing URLs), both approaches will enable the same level of analytical insight. Thus, the framework can accommodate diierent data ingestion strategies to support the infrastructure of the organization deploying it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Dataset Overview</head><p>We deployed the Golden Hour framework to collect and analyze one year of phishing web traac data between <ref type="bibr">October 1, 2018 and</ref><ref type="bibr">September 30, 2019 (inclusive)</ref> at the same organization mentioned in the previous section-a major nancial services provider and one of the most-targeted brands within the current ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. We provide an overview of the scope of all of our datasets in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Note that this data was collected ethically and in compliance with user privacy laws within the originally-intended context (see Section 8.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data Collection</head><p>We operated the Golden Hour framework in an online manner from July 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019 and additionally processed archived data from the preceding nine months. To eeciently query a data warehouse, we limited our observation window for web event data (as discussed in Section 3.3) to one week before and one week after the corresponding hostname appeared in a phishing feed. We found that this approach did not lead to the omission of any relevant events, as phishing URLs which remained live for longer periods would reappear in the feeds at a later date, and would thus also be extracted by our framework for analysis.</p><p>The resulting dataset initially contained a total of 22,553,707 web events resulting from traac to phishing websites from victims, attackers, and security crawlers alike. Using the traac data, we are able to gain detailed insight into stages B, D, E, and G within the life cycle of phishing attacks. For the framework's correlation ( 3 ) and reenement ( 5 ) steps, we programmatically queried additional data sources: phishing URLs for the same brand in the APWG eCrime Exchange feed, the organization's proprietary phishing URL feed, and the organization's proprietary automated (i.e., crawler) traac detection system ( 6 ).</p><p>During our deployment, we pruned 3,194,031 events by identifying traac to legitimate websites (based on a whitelist and manual review) and false-positive URLs that were under-represented in the phishing feeds or agged as such by the organization. Thus, our nal dataset contained 19,359,676 total events. These events corresponded to 404,628 distinct phishing URLs-more than either phishing feed we considered, as our hostname correlation enables the identiication of unreported variants of URLs similar to those which appeared in feeds. However, additional types of data are required to obtain timings of attack distribution (stage C) and monetization (stage F) and thus complete our end-to-end analysis, as these are not captured by the traac dataset alone.</p><p>Phishing URL Distribution: To measure URL distribution to victims, we extracted metadata from phishing emails that users forwarded (i.e., as spam reports) to the organization. The timestamps within the original email lures allow us to calculate when phishers originally distributed their attacks. To correlate these timestamps with web events in our traac dataset, we extracted URLs from each email and followed redirects (if any) to obtain the URL of the nal phishing landing page. In cases when a redirect was followed, or if the phishing URL was no longer accessible, we would additionally query the organization's internal anti-phishing system to obtain any other landing page URLs known to be previously associated with the URL in the email. To complete the correlation, we search for events within the traac dataset with the same hostname and a common path.</p><p>We were able to correlate 21,244 email reports with phishing URLs in our event dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . We found that 84.44% of these emails contained a timestamp detailed enough (i.e., date, time, and timezone) for our analysis. Determining nal landing page URLs from links within the email proved integral, as only 3.99% of emails contained the same URL as the nal phishing page (i.e., others made use of redirection).</p><p>Account Compromise and Monetization: To understand one way in which criminals exploit credentials from phishing victims, we analyzed session identiiers programmatically extracted from events in the traac dataset (i.e., victim visits to a phishing website which had cookies from a prior interaction with the legitimate organization's website). The organization then mapped these identiiers to user accounts and provided timestamps of fraudulent transactions associated with these accounts, and timestamps of when corresponding credentials appeared in a public dump. We could then correlate these timestamps with the victims' original interaction with the phishing page per the traac dataset.</p><p>Due to the sensitive nature of user information, we present our ndings related to this data in aggregate form only (in Section 5). Note that no Personally Identiiable Information (PII) was given to us for the purposes of this analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Level of Visibility</head><p>An immediate question that arises about our analysis concerns the level of visibility which can be provided by the Golden Hour framework. We deene visibility as the proportion of phishing websites that target the organization in our study that can be analyzed through our approach. While we cannot provide a deenite visibility measurement, as this would require knowledge of all phishing campaigns that target the organization, we estimate the visibility of our dataset by dividing the number of distinct hostnames with at least one associated web event by the total number of phishing hostnames, for the same brand, known to us from other data sources during the data collection period (i.e., in the APWG or organization's phishing URL feed). We also calculate the same ratio for full URLs. We note that it is easier for phishers to create multiple paths on a single domain compared to multiple subdomains; thus, the hostname ratio better represents unique attacks.</p><p>We found that our approach had visibility into an average of 39.1% of all hostnames and 40.9% of all URLs which were found in the aforementioned feeds and targeted the organization during our data collection period. We present the visibility ratios by month in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. Given the evasiveness of modern phishing attacks, we suspect that the list of phishing URLs known to us is an underestimate of phishing URLs in the wild <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>; however, consequently, the same would apply to the URLs for which we have event data.</p><p>The degree of visibility for both hostnames and URLs remained fairly consistent throughout our data collection period, with the exception of July 2019. During this month, we observed a spike to 50.2% and 57.1% visibility, respectively, which coincided with the launch of numerous sophisticated, large-scale attacks that were detectable by our approach. We discuss these attacks in more detail in Section 7.</p><p>Per the APWG eCrime Exchange, the brand in our dataset accounted for 10.6% of all phishing hostnames (with known brands) during the same one-year period. This allows the extrapolation of the potential visibility of our approach into the population of phishing websites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Event Distribution</head><p>We collected web events of two broad types: visits that occurred directly on phishing websites (Page URLs) and referral traac from a phishing website back to the organization's legitimate website (Referring URLs). We show the monthly distribution of these events in our dataset in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. We observe that phishing attacks are not uniformly distributed; some months see substantially more traac than others. Historically, phishing attacks have been associated with a certain seasonality, particularly near holidays. The spike in the nal three months of our dataset is consistent with the Q3 2019 APWG report, which found this period to have the largest volume of phishing URLs in three years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, we expose a limitation of counting URLs alone as a measurement of overall phishing volume, as the spike in our traac dataset is far more dramatic than the change in total URLs 2 .</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we further subdivide the events by the type of user. Events from Known Visitors are those which contain a session or device identiier previously known to the organization, and can thus be linked with certainty to a known account at the organization. Crawler events are those which we or the organization classiied as automated traac based on request attributes. The Other events fall into neither category but follow a similar distribution to Known Visitors, and thus represent potential victims which cannot be immediately traced back to an account at the organization.</p><p>To ensure consistency across our measurements in the following sections, we deene the set of Compromised Visitors as those Known Visitors whose accounts were subsequently either accessed by an attacker or had at least one fraudulent transaction. We consider only these events in our analysis of monetization eeorts, as the sequence of observations strongly suggests that a phishing attack succeeded against the corresponding victims. We do not disclose the total number of unique victims within these two sets for reasons discussed in Section 8.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Progression of Phishing Attacks</head><p>To create an end-to-end timeline of the progression of phishing attacks, we calculate the relative diierence between the timestamp of each Golden Hour web event and the   original detection of the corresponding phishing URL within a feed, as correlated by our framework. We calculate similar timestamp diierences for email lures, account compromise, and fraudulent account transactions. We can then plot a histogram of victim traac relative to attack detection, alongside the average timestamps of key attack milestones.</p><p>Note that the eeect of outliers on these averages is inherently suppressed by our use of a xed observation window for each phishing URL's web events. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, we show such a histogram for Compromised Visitors: in other words, every user represented in the gure was highly likely to have been successfully deceived by a phishing attack. We count multiple events from the same victim on the same phishing website only once. For brevity, we do not separate Page URL and Referring URL events in our gures, as these did not diier signiicantly except in the success rates of subsequent account compromise (discussed in Section 5.3).</p><p>We observe that phishers enjoy a large window of opportunity when carrying out their attacks. Nearly nine hours elapse on average between the rst victim visit and detection by the ecosystem. By this time, the phishing websites have already lured 62.73% of victims. Moreover, victim visits continue at a slower pace for the next 12 hours. We show the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of Compromised Visitor web events in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6a</ref>. Despite the 21-hour time frame (-08:44 to +12:26) of a typical phishing attack illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, there exist some attacks with a longer overall duration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Initial Traac</head><p>The average rst non-victim visit to each phishing website occurs 9 hours and 42 minutes prior to attack detection, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. We believe that such visits are representative of attackers' initial testing of each phishing website.  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: Geolocation of initial visits to live phishing websites, by traac category.</p><p>We performed an unequal variance T-test <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> to compare the distribution of the relative timestamps of the rst event (for each attack) within the Other category to the rst event for Known Visitors. We nd the means of the two distributions to be statistically signiicantly diierent, with a p value of 0.011. Furthermore, in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we show that top geolocations within the former set closely coincide with countries disproportionately associated with cybercrime <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (and inconsistent with the organization's customer base).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Phishing Email Distribution</head><p>We show the CDF of phishing email distribution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6b</ref>. We note that prior to attack detection, the cumulative proportion of victim visits to phishing websites (in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6a)</ref> grows at a faster rate than emails sent. In other words, traac from phishing emails to phishing websites drops after attack detection, as should be expected following the intervention of spam lters. However, just one day after detection, the rate of victim visits once again starts outpacing the sending of emails. This suggests that victims will follow links in old emails, and, thus, attackers continue to proot without further intervention. Take-down can potentially assist with mitigating these long-lasting phishing attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Progression of Monetization EEorts</head><p>In our dataset, the accounts of 7.42% of distinct Known Visitors subsequently suuered a fraudulent transaction; we believe this represents a lower bound on success rates and subsequent damage from phishing, as our approach does not identify victimization of the Other traac. After each victim's visit to a phishing website, we found that such a transaction would occur with an average delay of 5.19 days. However, as we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6c</ref>, fraudulent transactions grow consistently over a 14-day period, with the earliest ones occurring less than one hour after a victim visit. Although about 3.99% of fraudulent transactions occur after this period, the increasing potential for mitigation encourages attackers to act quickly.</p><p>The credentials of 63.61% of these compromised victims would additionally appear in a public dump, with an average  delay of 6.92 days. This trend suggests that criminals tend to rst monetize the accounts of their victims, and only later sell credentials within underground economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Our dataset does not provide insight into the monetization of each victim's stolen personal information beyond the organization's own systems. We nd that the average victim makes 2.43 page loads during his or her interaction with a phishing website-enough to visit a landing page and submit credentials. Some victims, however, made substantially more visits during a single session. After inspecting the chain of phishing URLs visited in such sessions, we believe that such victims provide additional personal information to the phishing website (i.e., one with multiple data collection forms), and could thus suuer from identity theft or other nancial fraud. Per our dataset, we observed that victims with an above-average number of page loads who also appeared in a Referring URL event (i.e., returned to the organization's website after presumably completing interaction with the phishing website) were 10.03 times more likely to later encounter a fraudulent withdrawal from their account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Browser-based Detection EEectiveness</head><p>Given the ubiquity of browser-based detection and warnings, the role of these defenses in preventing phishing in the wild is a key measurement we seek to estimate. The mitigation from browser-based detection can be delayed for two main reasons: failure of backend systems to ag a given phishing URL or the lag between backend agging and data propagation to clients (e.g., browsers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This lag period may vary between the same browser on diierent devices due to diierences in cache state <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</p><p>We can meaningfully estimate the overall impact of browser-based warnings on phishing attack eeectiveness by calculating the ratio of Compromised Visitors for browsers with native defenses (Google Safe Browsing, Windows Defender) and Compromised Visitors for all browsers, at regular time intervals after attack detection (i.e., after the midpoint of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>), and subsequently comparing this ratio to a baseline ratio just prior to detection. This ratio is not sensitive to the decrease in absolute phishing traac as it simply isolates the likelihood that the phishing attack will be successful (Compromised Visitors are visitors who likely submitted credentials to a phishing website).</p><p>As we show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>, browser-based warnings start to substantially reduce the relative eeectiveness of phishing attacks within one hour after detection, at which point the ratio of Compromised Visitors drops to 71.51%. By the end of the second hour, the ratio drops further to 43.55%: at this point, attacks are less than half as eeective as they were originally. The eeectiveness continues declining more slowly until the seventh hour and thereafter stabilizes within the 0-10% range. Browser-based phishing warnings are clearly an eeective mitigation overall, but attackers can and do abuse their reactive delay, as we have demonstrated. In addition, certain evasion techniques,which we discuss in Section 7.1,can avoid triggering such warnings even after attack detection. Additional mitigations are required to thwart the trickle of Compromised Visitor visits which we observed many hours after detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Phishing Attack Characteristics</head><p>In this section, we analyze metadata related to the phishing websites in our dataset in an eeort to better understand the characteristics of successful attacks. We consider all phishing URLs with at least one Compromised Visitor event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Phishing URL Classiication</head><p>Attackers have traditionally crafted phishing URLs to deceive victims by either mimicking the brand being impersonated by the phishing website (e.g., www.brand-alerts.com), or by including misleading keywords which convey a desire to help the victim (e.g., secure-my-account.com) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>We apply a previously-proposed classiication scheme [52] to the URLs in our dataset and show the results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>. We observe that 28.70% of all URLs have no deceptive content whatsoever; 34.76% have non-deceptive domains with deceptive paths only. 8.64% use deceptive subdomains on a non-deceptive domain, and the remaining 27.90% have deceptive domains (0.52% with Punycode). The nature of deceptiveness is similarly split between brand names and misleading keywords, except in the case of subdomains, which favor brand names. Bare IP addresses were negligible in our dataset and thus are excluded from the gure.</p><p>The vast majority of phishing URLs (98.58%) were hosted on traditional, paid domain names. Only 0.79% of URLs leveraged subdomains from free hosting providers; 0.63% had domains with free TLDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>. However, compromised hosting infrastructure plays a key role, which we assess in Section 7.</p><p>With the increasing use of mobile devices to browse the Internet, the importance of URL content has diminished (i.e., because of limited screen real estate on such devices) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72]</ref>. However, the heavy use of redirection in phishing lures  allows attackers to continue using deceptive URLs (which would otherwise be easily detectable by text-based classiiers) on their landing pages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Device and Browser Type</head><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>, mobile devices accounted for 62.73% of all victim traac in our dataset. Browsers protected by Google Safe Browsing-Chrome, Safari, and Firefox-accounted for 81.42% of the traac (roughly consistent with overall market share) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>. The wide use of these browsers, in particular on mobile platforms, underscores the importance of the eecacy of the anti-phishing features which they natively include. The Samsung Browser, which does not currently include browserbased phishing detection to the best of our knowledge, and thus leaves users particularly vulnerable to phishing, had a disproportionate representation of 7.97% in our dataset. The behavior of individual browsers has previously been studied in detail and is thus outside of the scope of our analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Use of HTTPS</head><p>The web has moved away from traditional HTTP in favor of encrypted communication over HTTPS; phishers started following this trend in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which has been simpliied through the wide availability of free SSL certiicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Within our entire dataset, 66.85% of distinct URLs used HTTPS. However, these URLs accounted for 85.77% of the Compromised Visitors.</p><p>Phishing attacks with HTTPS thus proved about three times more successful than HTTP. Even though some successful phishing attacks still occur on unencrypted websites, this now represents a minority of attacks. Simultaneously, the potential impact of Certiicate Authorities in helping prevent abuseespecially on attacker-controlled domains-has grown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Phishing Attack Longevity</head><p>Prior research has stipulated that individual phishing attacks tend to be short-lived and that they capitalize on the narrow gap between deployment and detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Despite some caveats, we have made a similar observation in Section 5. However, these observations do not capture trends within broader phishing campaigns, which may entail a group of organized criminals involved in the successive deployment of persistent and sophisticated attacks.   To gain better insight into long-term phishing campaigns, we group phishing URLs from events in our dataset by domain (or hostname in the case of free subdomain hosting providers). We then sort the groups by the total number of unique Known Visitor events to capture variations in hostname or path for attacks which are likely related 3 . We deene the date range of a campaign as the time between the rst and last web event from a Compromised Visitor; we found the average date range to be 13.55 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>USENIX Association</head><p>We discovered that the top 5% of attacks accounted for 77.79% of Known Visitor events within our dataset, and the top 10% for 89.13%, as shown in the CDF in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>. We then manually analyzed the top 20 campaigns (these alone accounted for 23.57% for Known Visitor events), some of which lasted several months each, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref>. We also determined whether they were hosted on compromised domains (i.e., otherwise belonging to a legitimate website) or domains directly controlled by attackers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Sophistication and Evasion</head><p>To understand the success of the top phishing attacks, we manually inspected the content (and, when possible, phishing kits) of high-impact phishing URLs that were live during our online deployment between July 1 and September 30, 2019. We identiied such URLs by spikes in the number of Known Visitor events associated with any individual hostname.</p><p>The characteristics we found contribute to the attacks' success not only by avoiding detection by anti-phishing infrastructure, but also by more eeectively targeting human victims. We quantify our observations to the extent possible given our methodology; however, a more comprehensive measurement would be suitable for future work.</p><p>Broad Data Collection: The sophisticated phishing websites which we analyzed mark a clear departure away from single-page login forms, and thus venture far beyond mere theft of usernames and passwords <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Phishers fully match the page structure of the victim organization's website, complete with a homepage with links to (fraudulent) login pages and resources in case the victim was to navigate away from the initial landing page. Once the victim returns to the login page and starts interacting with the phishing website, it will seek to harvest extensive personal and nancial information, identity documents, and even photographs (i.e., selles) to steal and more eeectively monetize victims' identities.</p><p>Automatic Translation: Five of the phishing websites in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> used the visitor's geolocation to automatically translate their deceptive content. Manual analysis of the phishing kit used on one of these websites revealed a total of 14 language options that coincided with the targeted brand's major markets.</p><p>Human Veriication: We observed that as part of a URL redirection chain, some attackers would show a reCAPTCHA challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[70]</ref> prior to redirecting the victim to the phishing landing page. Also, one speciic phishing kit showed a CAPTCHA challenge directly on its landing page, prior to allowing the victim to input any credentials. Such challenges not only hamper the veriication of phishing content by automated systems, but may also trick users into proceeding due to the use of CAPTCHA on legitimate websites.</p><p>Cloaking: All phishing websites which we analyzed leveraged server-side cloaking, a well-known technique that seeks to block traac based on a blacklist (or a whitelist) of request attributes such as IP address or hostname <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>. Such cloaking intends to restrict access from security crawlers or other non-victim entities. Also, some phishing kits include an initial landing page that contains nothing but a simple piece of JavaScript code or an HTML Meta tag to redirect the victim to the true phishing page. Such code could defeat basic crawlers that look at static HTML only.</p><p>Victim-speciic Paths: Eight of the campaigns in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> had a landing page that automatically generates a sub-path unique to each visitor's IP address, and then immediately redirects to that path. The path is not visible to other IP addresses, and would thus evade crawlers visiting a previouslygenerated path rather than the attack's initial landing page.</p><p>Fake Suspension Notices: As a deterrent to take-down eeorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, when a visitor fails cloaking checks, we observed that several phishing websites displayed a misleading page indicating that the domain has been suspended, rather than a generic HTTP 404 or 403 error message <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Man-in-the-Middle Proxies: Rather than a traditional phishing kit, two of the large phishing attacks we analyzed used a proxy that would make live requests to the legitimate organization's website and display the page to the user while intercepting all data submitted <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Such proxies can defeat most forms of two-factor authentication <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref> and may require special care from the targeted organization-such as requiring security keys-to mitigate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Attack Mitigation</head><p>While analyzing the sophisticated attacks in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref>, we simultaneously manually reported them to anti-phishing entities and hosting providers. By the time the many original URLs were added to detection backends, the attackers redeployed subsequent attacks on diierent subdomains or paths, which would, in turn, necessitate another cycle of reporting or detection. In this manner, attackers can stay one step ahead of the ecosystem. When paired with bulletproof hosting (i.e., resistant to take-down from abuse reports) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> or successive re-compromise of legitimate, albeit vulnerable, infrastructure, such attacks can remain eeective for prolonged periods.</p><p>To help overcome the challenges faced by the ecosystem, we adapted the Golden Hour framework to perform proactive mitigation of attacks. We reported events corresponding to Known Visitor back to the victim organization, such that the organization could ag accounts to prevent successful compromise or re-secure accounts that had already been compromised. We reported tens of thousands of distinct events in this manner, which has motivated the permanent adoption of our framework by the organization.</p><p>Our framework can also be used to discover previouslyunknown phishing URLs based on heuristics such as textual URL content (applied during correlation) or context. Such URLs can then be reported to detection backends and propagated through the ecosystem. Due to technical limitations, we did not automate this aspect of the framework during our deployment. In a retrospective analysis, we found that this would have potentially increased the number of web events in our dataset by 7.28%, which, if reported, could help narrow the gap in the detection of phishing attacks by the ecosystem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Discussion</head><p>Although individual evasion techniques might not suuce to defeat the modern anti-phishing ecosystem, the increased degree of sophistication which arises from the combination of such techniques poses a key threat. We have shown that in terms of the number of victims compromised, sophisticated and persistent phishing attacks dominate, and should, therefore, be a priority for the ecosystem. At a more granular level, both the response time of browser-based warnings (which protect victims once a phishing attack is detected by the ecosystem) and speed of initial detection by backends (which closes attackers' window of opportunity) represent potential directions for improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.1">Data Sharing</head><p>The mere fact that so many of phishing websites in our dataset embed third-party resources shows that attackers do not fear being detected by certain organizations. Consequently, there is an opportunity for increased data sharing across the ecosystem to better detect threats based on proactive intelligence indicative of attacks: the web events from Golden Hour are just one example of such intelligence.</p><p>Reporting Phishing: Sophisticated phishing attacks currently exploit limitations within the detection ecosystem. In the case of cloaked phishing websites, simple URL-based reporting to anti-phishing backends-such as what is currently commonly carried out through automated systems and web submission forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>-fails to provide suucient context for the backend to verify the phishing content. In particular, with only a URL in hand, the anti-phishing backend may not be able to determine the parameters required to defeat the cloaking or nd new, but related threats. We experienced this phenomenon when manually reporting certain URLs from the sophisticated attacks in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> to Google Safe Browsing; by the time such URLs were ltered, attackers would have shifted their websites to alternate paths or subdomains on the same web server. Enhanced phishing reporting protocols-potentially bolstered by trust between vetted entities within the ecosystem-could help anti-phishing entities share detailed attack data at scale. Similarly, with proper consent and privacy protections, suuciently detailed information could potentially be shared (e.g., request parameters, redirection chains, or a screenshot) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Such measures might help close the gap between what users see and anti-phishing systems see, thus preventing cloaking.</p><p>Similarly, the ecosystem currently lacks standardized approaches for requesting malicious content to be takendown <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Although major hosting providers may have well-documented avenues for removing phishing websites, attackers might migrate to bulletproof hosting <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> or small hosts with fewer resources for timely intervention, or by compromising infrastructure.</p><p>Phishing Links in Emails: Attackers make heavy use of redirection links in phishing email lures. As we have shown, such links complicate the correlation of phishing emails with live websites-and, in turn, hamper further mitigation eeorts, such as browser-based detection. Additionally, we observed an average delay of 9.62 hours between the start of each phishing email campaign (i.e., the initial arrival of a phishing message) and the rst report sent by a victim. Due to this delay, we believe that direct user reports should only serve as a secondary means for entities to discover new phishing attacks. As such, there is a potential for email providers to share known abusive URLs with the wider ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In our dataset, at the granularity of individual phishing hostnames, email lures were sent in large spikes, similar to what has been previously observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. If a message is initially classiied as benign but the URL within it is later detected as phishing, additional measures are needed to ensure retroactive detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.2">Third-party Resources</head><p>It may seem counter-intuitive for malicious websites to embed external web resources hosted by third parties, especially in light of our ndings that these resources enable both analysis and mitigation of phishing attacks. However, we argue that phishing websites will nevertheless use external resources for a number of reasons.</p><p>Most importantly, anti-phishing systems use known lenames of scripts, images, favicons, and archives as one type of ngerprinting to identify malicious websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>. Phishing pages which only link to external les can avoid such ngerprinting entirely; with the added use of cloaking on their landing pages, phishing websites can remain stealthy to avoid or delay detection by the ecosystem.</p><p>In some cases, attackers choose to use third-party services for their own beneet. Within our dataset, the use of reCAPTCHA is one such example. Additionally, we observed phishing websites hosted on single-page pastebin services <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In order for phishing pages to render correctly on such services (and thus successfully deceive victims), most images and scripts must be retrieved from external sources.</p><p>The use of external les can also ensure consistency between the look and feel of the legitimate website and a phishing page. Phishing kits can thus remain current without the need for frequent updates, which may be particularly desirable for phishers who do not want to invest money into sophisticated phishing kits. It is also easier for attackers to directly copy the source of the original page than to build a deceptive version from scratch.</p><p>Even if they do not embed third-party resources, phishing websites may link back to the legitimate organization's website and could thus be detected by our approach. The same applies if victims are redirected back to the legitimate website after being phished: a common strategy used by attackers to minimize victims' awareness of the attack.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.3">Limitations</head><p>Our analysis should be considered alongside certain limitations. Despite a large sample size, our data is based on victim traac to phishing websites that target a single organization, which may skew our ndings. However, our Golden Hour framework is not tied to any one organization; thus, future analysis in other contexts could deepen the insight into the broader ecosystem.</p><p>Due to the nature of our agreements with the organization, we cannot disclose certain concrete ndings from our analysis, such as the total proot secured by attackers. Also, the success of phishing attacks hinges on numerous factors-such as the content and type of the original lure, appearance of the landing page, or redirection services used-which we did not consider, but which could provide details about the ecosystem vulnerabilities being exploited.</p><p>Despite the incentives for phishers to use third-party resources, as discussed in Section 8.2, our approach does not guarantee the detectability of an arbitrary phishing website. Phishers could deliberately evade our approach by excluding any trackable third-party les and avoiding redirecting victims back to the organization's website.</p><p>The timeframe of our email dataset is shorter than that of our web event dataset. We originally intended to correlate the event data with phishing URLs sent to victim inboxes at a major email provider over the full data collection period. However, the prevalence of redirection links within phishing emails made such correlation diicult to scale.</p><p>Lastly, our web event correlation approach (stage 3 of the framework) beneets from the ability to accurately classify URLs as suspicious from within a large stream of traac data, or a reliable source of ground truth (i.e., known phishing URLs) to match events. We only did the latter during our deployment; however, we consider our data sources (in Section 4.1) to be of high quality: peaks in Crawler traac in our event dataset coincided with detection times of URLs in the phishing feeds considered. Yet, recent research has shown that even reputable anti-phishing vendors fail to identify many phishing URLs reported to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>. Future deployments of our approach should maximize the number of data sources for correlation to further increase visibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.4">Ethical Considerations</head><p>We took great care to ensure that user privacy was preserved throughout this research. Our analysis did not involve access to any PII, and processing which entailed datasets that could contain PII (such as user account information or email report content) was carried out in a purely programmatic fashion by existing, automated systems. During our analysis of user account compromise times, we only handled anonymized session or account identiiers which were interpreted and aggregated by the organization with which we collaborated.</p><p>Entities that become aware of compromised accounts within their systems-through internal or external data sources-should make reasonable eeorts to re-secure such accounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>. During our research, we ensured that user accounts which we associated with phishing website traac by Golden Hour were appropriately agged by the organization. Furthermore, we recommended that user accounts that likely visited sophisticated phishing websites be investigated in an eeort to identify and thwart the underlying threat actors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Related Work</head><p>Because phishing attacks are by nature spread across diverse infrastructure, empirical measurements of the relationships between the diierent attack phases are diicult. Nevertheless, such measurements can deliver crucial insights that are not possible at a ner granularity. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the rst to paint an end-to-end picture of phishing attacks at scale by correlating victim traac to live phishing websites with attack distribution and monetization.</p><p>The work most similar to ours is that of Heijden and Allodi <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>, who leveraged methodology similar to Golden Hour to correlate URLs in phishing emails (reported to an organization) with the timestamps of clicks by individual victims. The authors combined the click data with email content analysis to identify cognitive and technical factors that characterize successful phishing emails, which can help prioritize the mitigation of high-impact phishing URLs.</p><p>Han et al. monitored the life cycles of phishing kits installed on a honeypot <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Unlike our approach, the authors captured the credentials sent by each phishing kit and more closely analyzed attackers' interaction with the kit. However, honeypots are limited in scale and scope compared to our approach and do not ooer insight into the damage caused by phishing, such as how stolen credentials are ultimately used.</p><p>Thomas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref> analyzed a one-year dataset of data breaches, phished credentials, and keyloggers to study trends in the users victimized by such attacks, and the eeectiveness of each type of attack. Although this work did not strictly focus on phishing attack anatomy, it underscores the eeectiveness of large-scale, cross-organizational data analysis to capture the state of the ecosystem.</p><p>Ho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> analyzed over 113 million emails sent by employees of enterprise organizations to model lateral phishing attacks carried out via compromised email accounts.</p><p>The authors revealed new types of attacks marked by both sophistication and eeectiveness. Although this work does not focus on traditional phishing, it shows that important insight can be gained from analyzing attack data at scale.</p><p>Other prior work has scrutinized the time between phishing attack detection and blacklisting <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Oest et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref> conducted a controlled empirical analysis of the eeectiveness of evasion techniques against the response time and coverage of blacklists. The study revealed weaknesses in blacklists and measured the gap between attack detection and mitigation under speciic conditions.</p><p>In early measurements of the ecosystem, Moore and Clayton analyzed the temporal relationship between the sending of spam emails and the availability of phishing websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and the latency between phishing deployment and detection by anti-phishing blacklists <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The authors cited a need for take-down due to the persistence of spam campaigns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Conclusion</head><p>At their disposal, phishers have an array of sophisticated techniques that aim to circumvent existing anti-phishing defenses and increase the likelihood of compromising victims. With the addition of underground resources, such attacks are scalable, as has long been observed by the ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, the ecosystem itself is not powerless to ght back, as it has access to a wealth of data that can be used to analyze, detect, and prevent phishing. By correlating data from multiple ecosystem sources, we performed a longitudinal, end-to-end life cycle analysis of phishing attacks on a large scale: we not only gained insight into the timing of key events associated with modern phishing attacks, but also identiied the gaps in defenses that phishers actively target.</p><p>Phishing remains a signiicant threat to Internet users in part because the reactive anti-phishing defenses that are standard throughout the ecosystem, such as browser-based detection and warnings, struggle to eeectively address the agility and sophistication of attackers. Importantly, analysis such as that carried out in our research can inform anti-phishing entities of an appropriate response time threshold for speciic mitigations, to ultimately narrow the window of opportunity available to phishers.</p><p>Our use of the Golden Hour framework to automatically secure the accounts of tens of thousands of phishing victims also motivates the continued expansion of proactive mitigations within the ecosystem. The framework could be practically adapted by any organization (commonly targeted by phishers) with access to its own phishing URL and web traac data, and can help seal gaps in defenses by securing compromised user accounts and enabling earlier detection of phishing websites. Moreover, closer collaboration between anti-phishing entities, coupled with the development of enhanced and standardized mechanisms for sharing intelligence, would allow such mitigations to better scale to the ecosystem level.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: High-level stages of a typical phishing attack.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> The uncorrelated emails either were outside of the visibility of our approach, or had redirection chains which could not be reconstructed. We discuss the relatively small size of our email dataset in Section 8.3.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> We believe that both of these spikes are associated with the eeectiveness (and proliferation) of highly sophisticated phishing websites, which we characterize in Section 7.1.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> Some threat actors pivot across diierent infrastructure and might thus be underestimated by domain-based grouping of attacks. Conndently grouping attacks by other attributes, such as phishing kit signature or drop email, would require additional data. The same applies in case diierent threat actors were to leverage a single domain.</note>
