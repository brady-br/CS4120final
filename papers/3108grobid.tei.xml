				<p>Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM) is being intensively explored as a promising on-chip last-level cache (LLC) replacement for SRAM, thanks to its low leakage power and high storage capacity. However, the write penalties imposed by STT-MRAM challenges its incarnation as a successful LLC by deteriorating its performance and energy efficiency. This write performance characteristic unfortunately makes STT-MRAM unable to straightforwardly substitute SRAM in many computing systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA) by employing STT-MRAM as a read-oriented on-chip storage. The key observation here is that many cache lines in LLC are only touched by read operations without any further write updates. These cache lines, referred to as singular-writes, can be internally migrated from SRAM to STT-MRAM in our hybrid NUCA. Our approach can significantly improve the system performance by avoiding many cache read misses with the larger STT-MRAM cache blocks, while it maintains the cache lines requiring write updates in the SRAM cache. Our evaluation results show that, by utilizing the read-oriented STT-MRAM storage, our hybrid NUCA can better the performance of a conventional SRAM-only NUCA and a dead block aware STT-MRAM NUCA by 30% and 60% with 45% and 8% lower energy values, respectively.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Last-level cache (LLC) is utilized as a shared resource in most commercial multicore products and co-processor architectures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, making it a pivotal design component in determining both system performance and energyefficiency. While many emerging applications enjoy the massive parallelism and high computational power of multicore systems, they are required to manage large datasets presenting challenge of scale, which in turn leads to the demand for integrating larger LLCs in modern computing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) has been the prevailing technology for on-chip cache, successfully catering to the latency demands of the high performance processors. However, SRAM's cell design constitutes a large number of transistors (usually six, at least four), making it a low-density device with considerably high leakage power. With increasing demand for larger caches, SRAM is struggling to keep up with the density and energy-efficiency requirements set by state-of-theart system designs.</p><p>Thanks to the device-level advantages of STT-MRAM such as high-density structure, zero leakage current, and very high endurance, it comes out as an excellent candidate to replace age-old SRAM for LLC design. However, the performance of STT-MRAM is critically sensitive to write frequency due to its high write latency and energy values. Therefore, an impulsive replacement of SRAM with high-density STT-MRAM, simply for increasing LLC capacity, can deteriorate cache performance and introduce poor energy consumption behavior.</p><p>Extensive research is taking place to address these challenges. Guangyu et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> proposed a 3D-stacked STT-MRAM, which intends to hide the long-latency of STT-MRAM on writes by adding a small SRAM write buffer to each STT-MRAM bank. Asit K. et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> discussed a memory request scheduling scheme on a 3D multicore environment integrating STT-MRAM, which aims to resolve the STT-MRAM write issues at the onchip network level. This approach promoted an idea of re-routing subsequent requests to idle cache banks, instead of the write-busy bank. While these proposed schemes can partially alleviate the write overhead problem imposed by STT-MRAM, the quest for an energyefficient cache still remains unconquered. In addition, the hybrid cache using SRAM-based write buffer is unaware of application behaviors, and its benefits are restricted by the amount of available buffer at runtime.</p><p>We observe that performance and energy-efficiency of a hybrid cache critically depend on its internal datamovement trend, and by studying such trends we can modify the cache architecture accordingly to get the best out of it. Specifically, we observe that nearly 90% of the data in a LLC can actually be written only once during its lifetime, which has been reported as "deadwrites" in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. One of the potential approaches to eliminate STT-MRAM's disadvantages, being aware of this deadwrite characteristics, is to bypass the writes associated to the deadwrites to the underlying main memory. However, we also observe that, about 60% of total read misses results from such bypassed write data.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a Read-Oriented STT-MRAM Storage (ROSS) based non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA), that can avail combined benefits of a hybrid design and the data movement/usage trends in a LLC. We built upon the standard NUCA architecture, and modified it to develop a high-capacity hybrid cache where designated SRAM banks are replaced with STT-MRAM banks. This inclusion of high-density STT-MRAM blocks enables the cache to attain larger storage capacity, as well as higher energy efficiency. In our proposed architecture, cache data with singular-write characteristics (i.e., data is written only once and is not rereferenced by any latter write operations) are migrated from the SRAM cache blocks to the STT-MRAM blocks inside the LLC, rather than bypassing them to the main memory. As a result, our proposed scheme allows the cache controller to free up sufficient SRAM blocks for write intensive data, without sustaining the read operation overheads imposed by off-chip memory accesses. Our comprehensive evaluation results show that, our ROSS cache significantly improves the overall LLC performance, incurring only a minor overhead from the data migration process. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• Evaluation of data movement trend in the LLC. We extensively evaluate data read and write trend in the LLC for a wide range of memory-intensive workloads. This motivational evaluation allows us to better understand the actual trend of data movement in the LLC, and to modify our architecture accordingly, for optimum performance and energy-efficiency.</p><p>• Development of ROSS based NUCA. Motivated from the observations, we propose two novel hybrid ROSS based non-uniform cache architectures. The first one is hybrid ROSS (HB-ROSS) that takes advantage of SRAM's low write latency and small write power as well as STT-MRAM's high density and energy efficiency by detecting and retiring data with singular-write from SRAM to STT-MRAM. Second, to further optimize energy efficiency, early retirement ROSS (ER-ROSS) is designed to reduce SRAM capacity, while maintaining high performance. Differing from HB-ROSS, ER-ROSS retires all potential singular-write data sets at early stage.</p><p>• Comprehensive system-level evaluation. We evaluate and compare our proposed ROSS-based NUCA with a SRAM-only NUCA and a dead block aware STT-MRAM based NUCA, and show that our proposed ROSS caches show significant improvement in terms of both cache performance and energy-efficiency. Specifically, compared to the prior work, our singular-write aware ROSS cache improves LLC performance by upto 60%, and consumes upto 50% less energy at system level.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>STT-MRAM Cache.</p><p>Compared to SRAM, STT-MRAM is comprised of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) and a single access transistor. As a result, STT-MRAM caches have higher density (3x ∼ 4x) and lower leakage power. However, for the write operation, STT-MRAM involves physical rotation of the MTJ free layer, which requires high write latency and write power consumption. High write overhead becomes a serious obstacle for STT-MRAM to completely replace SRAM. NUCA. In modern cache architectures, large LLC is employed to relieve the burden of frequent accesses to underlying main memory. However, global wire delay followed by increased cache area size, has emerged as a dominant factor for increasing cache access time and more access contentions. The non-uniform cache architecture (NUCA) is proposed to reduce the penalty of long wire delay by dividing the cache into smaller banks. Each bank has non-uniform latency based on bank locations, smaller than what it would be if the whole cache was a uniform cache.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Design and Implementation of ROSS</head><p>In this section, we first describe the motivation behind our proposed ROSS based NUCA architecture, and then discuss about the LLC topology, NUCA baseline and ROSS scheme. At last, we provide the implementation details of ROSS. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows cache eviction trend for the tested workloads and "1" ∼ "&gt;5" denote the number of writes on cache blocks. One can observe from this figure that, nearly 90% of the written data are actually never rewritten before their eviction, referred to singular-writes. Singular-writes can be generated by different situations such as data fill by a single read-miss, a redundant write just before a write-back, or an access sequence to a cache block ending with a write-back request. In addition, we make another critical observation from our motivational evaluation regarding singular writes.  ure 2 shows the distribution of read-misses for evicted data that experience different times of write operations. In the figure, each column presents the total number of read-misses. One can observe from this figure that the number of read misses caused by evicting data which has singular writes accounting for more than 60% of the total read misses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Motivation</head><p>Based on these observations, we propose our ROSSbased NUCA where the data blocks with multiple writes are assigned to SRAM blocks to take advantage of SRAM's low write latency, while the data blocks with singular writes which are less impacted by longer write latency, can be migrated in STT-MRAM, and can reap the benefit of huge capacity brought by STT-MRAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">An Overview of ROSS Architecture</head><p>As the capacity of LLC keeps increasing, the conventional single-bank cache architecture exposes significant latency overhead, due to the high RC delay of long wordlines and bitlines. To mitigate such high latency, we divide LLC into heterogeneous (SRAM and STT-MRAM) cache banks to model the bottom line of our hybrid cache (referred to as "ROSS"). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref> shows the topological overview of our proposed ROSS-based NUCA. Our proposed hybrid cache consists of 64 cache banks, which are connected by a point-to-point mesh network and managed by our LLC controller. The LLC controller is responsible for coordinating cache accesses inside LLC, communicating with memory and lower-level cache, and making decision on data replacement. On the other hand, each cache bank is built up by either SRAM array or STT-MRAM array. To take advantage of SRAM's shorter access latency, the SRAM-based cache bank is placed close to the LLC controller, which can significantly reduce the wire latency overhead, while STT-MRAM banks are placed off the LLC controller.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Read-Oriented Hybrid NUCA</head><p>Traditional NUCA designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> are not optimized as a platform for ROSS based LLC. In this work, we propose  a well-tailored NUCA and its corresponding cache management policy, which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. Tailored NUCA. Considering the data movement overhead (high write latency and energy consumption) in STT-MRAM banks, we employ S-NUCA which statically maps data to STT-MRAM banks and does not allow data migration later on. On the other hand, SRAM banks follow the rule of D-NUCA strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which adjusts hot data sets among SRAM banks to achieve best access latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In addition, due to the limited SRAM capacity, SRAM banks are also designed to migrate singularwrite data to STT-MRAM banks. Consequently, internal data migration only happens between SRAM banks or from SRAM to STT-MRAM banks. Cache access workflow in ROSS. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the basic cache management policy for our ROSS cache. If one data request misses in L1 cache, that request continues to inquire the cache banks in LLC. In case of cache hit in either SRAM bank or STT-MRAM bank, that bank will serve the requested data directly to the host . On the other hand, if cache misses in LLC, memory fill will be done to SRAM blocks on read miss and data block will be written to SRAM banks on writeback miss . Considering multicore system is sensitive to latency, such cache miss strategy is optimized to provide fast write response. When more space is required in SRAM banks, SRAM banks will migrate cache blocks to STT-MRAM banks . The specific migration policy will be described later on. Finally, when STT-MRAM is full, it will evict data blocks to underlying memory based on pseudo LRU policy . Address mapping policy. Multibanked cache shows substantial flexibility for mapping lines to banks, as data can be placed in any cache line of any cache bank. However, such mapping policy incurs overwhelming memory and latency overheads to maintain a big address mapping table. To balance the trade off between bank utilization and overhead, we applied simple mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>. According to simple mapping, 4 SRAM banks and 4 STT-MRAM banks are grouped as a bank set. The bank set can be regarded as an associative cache structure with each cache set spreading across multiple banks. Each bank consists of several pairs of tag arrays and data arrays as one or more ways of the cache set (c.f. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a)</ref>. Based on the modified cache structure, the search address has been partitioned into Tag, Index, and Bank set. Any incoming cache request will be mapped to one bank set based on Bank set field. Data search policy. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>, when searching for a data block in cache, cache controller decides which bank set the data belongs to, according to the bank set. Then, the remaining address information is sent to each pair of tag array and data array in banks of the matched bank set. Specifically, the Index field is used by row decoder to activate rows in tag arrays and tag field is used for comparison. Data migration policy. In our hybrid ROSS (HB-ROSS) design, whenever a SRAM bank is full and should clean up space for incoming data, one cache block which was written for one time (singular-write candidate) is selected to move to a STT-MRAM bank. If there are multiple candidates, the oldest data block among them is retired. We assume that the oldest data that only experiences an onetime write has the highest possibility to be a singularwrite data during its lifetime, and therefore should be migrated to a STT-MRAM bank. Unfortunately, HB-ROSS cannot sufficiently relieve the network burden of data migration from SRAM to STT-MRAM banks. For better performance, we introduce an aggressive Early Retirement ROSS (ER-ROSS) cache design. In ER-ROSS, instead of passively migrating single cache block to STT-MRAM on cache fill, cache controller searches for all qualified cache blocks and migrates them to STT-MRAM when network is not busy. While this aggressive migration cannot guarantee all the cache blocks are singular-write, the penalty can be mitigated with significant advantages such as lower leakage from less SRAM banks, and relieving of potential traffic burst by offering more free space in SRAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Design Details of ROSS</head><p>To support the functionality of ROSS scheme, we incorporate a few components inside the cache controller. Firstly, multiple status registers are organized as a bitmap table for every cache line to indicate the number of write requests accessed by each data. Status "0" represents data with one-time write, while status "1" means the corresponding cache line is accessed by multiple write operations. These status registers are initialized or updated after cache register handles incoming read/write requests. In addition, we add 8-bit timing counters for every cache line in SRAM banks to cooperate with status registers by storing more cache lines' information. The timing counter has three operations: Initialize: Whenever a cache line is updated with a new data block, the corresponding timing counter will be reset by the cache controller. For example, as for singularwrite data, the timing counter only reset when its cache line get filled. On the other hand, as for multi-write data, the timing counter is reset when cache line is accessed by a write request. Note that timing counter cannot replace status registers, as timing counter cannot distinguish between singular-write data and multi-write data. Poll: We introduce a polling mechanism to increment every timing counter periodically, unless a timing register has reached its maximum. Another responsibility of the polling mechanism is to check if any timing counter has reached the predefined threshold (e.g. 200). if one cache line exceeds the threshold which means no write requests access the cache line for a long time, the cache line would be evicted to a STT-MRAM bank. Evict: In HB-ROSS, evicting a cache line from SRAM banks to STT-MRAM banks follows two criteria: "Status register = 0" and "Max of all timing counters", which decide the "oldest singular-write data". On the other hand, in ER-ROSS, "Status register = 0" and "timing counter reaches threshold" are the criterion to evict cache lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation Methodology</head><p>Simulation Setup. For our evaluation, we have used the gem5 simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, one of the most recognized architectural simulators. We modified the cache segment of the simulator to evaluate the STT-MRAM cache and our proposed hybrid configurations. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> depicts the main simulation parameters. Simulated Configurations. In our evaluation, we compared two variations of our proposed ROSS architecture with SRAM-only NUCA and dead block aware STT-MRAM-only NUCA. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows the details of the four architectures.</p><p>• Normal Non-Uniform Cache Architecture (ND-NUCA). In this model, the whole on-chip cache is constructed with traditional SRAM in D-NUCA model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>• Dead Block aware Non-Uniform Cache Architecture (DB-NUCA). The entire cache banks are made up of STT-MRAM. The DB-NUCA is also aware of deadblocks, and bypasses dead blocks directly to the offchip memory in an attempt to avoid the write penalties brought by STT-MRAM. We mimic the implementation of dead block detection in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>• Hybrid Read-Oriented STT-MRAM Storage (HB-ROSS). In this configuration, half of SRAM cache banks are replaced with STT-MRAM. HB-ROSS migrates singular-writes only when the SRAM banks have no more room.</p><p>• Early Retirement aware Read-Oriented STT-MRAM Storage (ER-ROSS). This configuration represents our complete scheme for designing a high-performance albeit energy-efficient cache architecture. Here, six-eighth of the SRAM cache blocks are replaced with STT-MRAM blocks, greatly increasing the capacity of the cache. It also has the ability to retire multiple data blocks at an early stage.    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> shows the evaluation result of the six workloads we evaluated, which including the system performance and energy comparison of the two ROSS cache configurations with the DB-NUCA and ND-NUCA. Raw IPC (Instructions Per Cycle). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5a</ref>, for all eight workloads, HB-ROSS outperforms the baseline ND,DB-NUCA by 20% and 50%, respectively. ER-ROSS outperforms the baseline ND/DB-NUCA by 30% and 60%, respectively. This result supports our expectation that, the high storage capacity and better utilization of SRAM blocks in ROSS cache enable better performance from the cache. In addition, ER-ROSS provides, on average, 10% better performance than HB-ROSS. For the three workloads libquantum, sjeng and gobmk, HB-ROSS performs slightly better than ER-ROSS. However, it should be noted that, in addition to the core cache architecture, IPC performance is also dependent on various other system parameters and workload characteristics.  LLC Read-miss Rate. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5b</ref> shows the read-miss rate in the last-level cache (LLC). DB-NUCA shows a higher read-miss rate than ND-NUCA by 67%, on average; which is unexpected considering that DB-NUCA enjoys a much higher capacity STT-MRAM LLC. We believe this degradation in read-miss is caused by the 'bypass all singular-write to memory' policy, since 60% of those singular-write has to be retrieved by read operations. Importantly, for all eight workloads, both HB/ER-ROSS outperforms the ND-NUCA by 55%, on average. This result supports our claim that, ROSS can substantially improve cache performance by not migrating singular-writes to the off-chip memory. In addition, for all eight workloads ER-ROSS provides, on average, 5% better performance than HB-ROSS. We believe this is because, ER-ROSS, compared to HB-ROSS, terminates many more defunct cache line at an early stage and keeps the LLC free for future read operations. Cache energy consumption. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5c</ref> shows the energy consumption by the four cache architectures for the eight workloads. As expected, the cache energy component is dominated by static leakage energy. From the figure one can see that, the baseline ND-NUCA, with its all-SRAM design, shows the worst performance in terms of cache energy consumption. DB-NUCA reduces leakage energy by replacing SRAM with STT-MRAM, and improves the baseline performance by 40%, on average. Both HB/ER-ROSS displays similar cache energy consumption as DB-NUCA, and shows performance improvement of 45%, on average, over ND-NUCA. Specifically, for the lbm workload, ER-ROSS improves energy consumption compared to the baseline ND-NUCA by 60%. Finally, ER-ROSS improves energy consumption of HB-ROSS by 5%, on average.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a hybrid NUCA using ReadOriented STT-MRAM Storage (ROSS), which is able to fully utilize the benefits of STT-MRAM by detecting and deploying singular-write data in STT-MRAM banks. The evaluaion results show that, our proposed ROSS caches exhibit upto 60% and 50% improvement in terms of performance and energy-efficiency, compared to prior work.</p></div>
