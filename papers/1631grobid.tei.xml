<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Digital forensics is the application of science to lawful investigation. It is a field strongly driven by practitioners who can readily adapt cutting-edge research. Consequently, researchers have an enormous opportunity for impact by transforming novel research results into techniques that can be used by investigators. The need is great: the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recently published a scathing report calling for a scientific overhaul of digital forensics <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Further, prevalent forensic techniques do not scale and already the demand for forensic examination is much greater than current capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Our group has taken up this call, and we work directly with many law enforcement organizations.</p><p>Unfortunately, experiences like ours in deploying wellused tools based on novel forensic research are rare. More typically, computer security research aimed towards forensic applications has little or no impact -often because the researchers are poorly acquainted with the real-world problems faced by forensic investigators and the constraints placed on solving them. Similarly, when forensic research is evaluated using the viewpoints held by computer security venues, the challenges, constraints, and usefulness of the work is often misjudged.</p><p>Adding to the confusion, the technical overlap between security and forensics can falsely color one's view of the latter. For example, packet attribution techniques proposed by security researchers can be useful for determining the source IP address for network-level attacks, but as Clark and Landau <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> point out, such mechanisms are "neither as useful nor as necessary as it would appear" for investigations that require identification of a person rather than a machine. We generalize that statement further: many technical mechanisms across computer security for attribution, identification, and classification are neither sufficient nor necessary for forensically valid digital investigations. Developing a security mechanism for, say, remote identification of a device, and claiming it works for forensics is akin to developing a new cryptographic hash function and claiming it can be applied to many security problems: the claim is easy to make, but the impact is negligible.</p><p>In general, digital forensics is concerned with techniques (1) that support or refute a hypothesis that explains a person's violation of law or organizational policy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> such that the investigator is limited by a defined set of procedural restrictions for gathering evidence; (3) where the value of evidence is defined by a qualitative context and not only quantitative measure; (4) and where the error rates and procedures of techniques are known and testable.</p><p>Contributions. We define many key aspects of digital forensics with the goal of ensuring that papers seeking to advance the discipline will have the highest possible impact on investigators. Our observations are based largely on our experience working directly with practitioners <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> and advancing work <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> that operates within forensic constraints that we detail within this paper. While we focus primarily on investigations in the context of the U.S. legal system, our conclusions are applicable to most other forensic contexts. At a high level, these constraints are as follows.</p><p>• Digital forensics is investigator-centric, and unless developed with an understanding of the restrictions that investigators are under, most novel results cannot and will not be adopted. For example, prior to the issuance of a warrant, techniques for criminal investigators cannot violate plain view observation, and evidence gathered otherwise would be suppressed in court.</p><p>• The value of a new technique depends in part on its complexity and therefore it must be judged against simpler options available to investigators. Similarly, defenses against investigation should not be evaluated with an assumption that high precision is always needed. For example, civil investigations are often based on simple subpoena and mere demonstration of relevance; sophisticated investigative techniques may be needlessly restrictive or indirect compared to capabilities and information available after subpoena.</p><p>• Forensic techniques are most valuable when addressing the most common adversary, not the strongest; there is no correlation between technical savvy and dangerousness to society. It is not possible for one savvy criminal to destroy, hide, or obfuscate the evidence of everyone else. In contrast, security work must consider that one person can leverage a vulnerability to attack every computer that uses the flawed system.</p><p>• Finally, forensic investigations seek to find the person responsible rather than stopping at a machine or line of code. Consequently, the scope of forensics is often more broad than that of the traditional security domain. For example, most any policy or law requires consideration of a person's intent, something that is often demonstrated indirectly through an amalgamation of facts and evidence.</p><p>Our position is that security venues should publish forensics research, but these works should be evaluated in the proper context. When selecting reviewers, ensure they can examine papers using the goals and principles of digital forensics and not just those of computer security.</p><p>The reviewer himself should question if the authors are actually looking outside of the computer security problem when claiming an approach is applicable to forensics. Otherwise, the security community risks encouraging low-impact work while rejecting worthwhile solutions to forensic problems.</p><p>In Section 2 we begin by enumerating general legal and practical constraints placed on forensic investigators in the context of the U.S. legal system. We then move to briefly describing the wider scope of investigations forensics examiners face. In Section 3, we review a set of useful lessons for researchers regarding the applicability of techniques to digital forensics, and highlight recent work in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Forensic Investigations</head><p>The highest impact work in forensics works within, and is evaluated under, the real constraints and goals of investigations. In this section, we detail general models for criminal and civil scenarios, and we describe how investigations are focused on people rather than systems.</p><p>In both civil and criminal contexts, digital forensics is concerned with techniques that address the four points stated in the introduction: (1) hypothesis testing, (2) procedural constraints, (3) evidentiary value, and (4) error rates. Practice provides another set of constraints. For example, all methods rely on acquisition of evidence, yet data is commonly destroyed, lost, stolen, or encrypted. The capacity of investigators to take on new cases is limited, and selection is based on many external factors. Even if a case is accepted, there is often too much data to image, store, and process, and an imperfect triage process is frequently necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Criminal Investigations</head><p>Criminal investigations take place along two phases, a pre-warrant (plain view) phase, occurring prior to the issuance of a search warrant, and a post-warrant phase.</p><p>Pre-warrant phase. In this plain view phase, investigators are limited by U.S. law, stemming largely from the Fourth Amendment, that dictates what can acquired before a warrant is in place. The main goal of this phase is to meet the probable cause standard for obtaining a magistrate-issued warrant. This standard is is a qualitative measure often defined as meeting a "fair probability" that further evidence will be found in the location to be searched; see U.S. v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. <ref type="bibr">1 (1989)</ref>. Probable cause does not require that the evidence is strong enough for conviction, merely that the evidence support a reasonable belief that the suspect committed a crime. The caveat is that the collected evidence must be in plain view and therefore not violate a person's expectation of privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . During this phase, general criminal activity is monitored, and then specific targets are selected among available suspects. The choice of target is a balance between dangerousness to society and efficiency of case execution.</p><p>Post-warrant phase. In this phase, investigators are limited only by a court-issued warrant. Warrants require particularity, which limits the place to be searched; for example, its unlikely to get a warrant for all apartments in a building, nor does having a warrant for one allow investigators to enter another. Warrants also require specificity which defines the type of item to be found. In digital contexts, it's hard to violate specificity since any computing device is typically a viable target.</p><p>After obtaining a warrant, there are few legal restrictions on law enforcement's technical approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> However, in order to obtain a conviction in court, the investigator must collect a higher standard of evidence. This evidence must help prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a suspect committed a crime.</p><p>Peer review of digital forensics research must include an analysis of the legal justification required to employ proposed techniques. Techniques that don't require special privileges are applicable to the broadest number of settings and therefore are the most desirable. But such papers should provide the justification that a warrant or other restrictions, such as Kyllo v. U.S., do not apply; see our discussion of Admissibility below. If post-warrant capabilities are indeed required, the paper should detail why easier technical solutions aren't available to obtain the same results. For example, it's likely that watermarking the outgoing traffic of a user requires a wiretap; at that point, the criminal investigator will find it just as easy to get a warrant to install a covert key-logger or other device on the target's computer. We return to this point in Section 3.</p><p>Exceptions to the Fourth Amendment. The law underlying realistic investigative models shifts frequently. For example, courts have long held that there are exceptions to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, but these exceptions are not always clear in the case of digital evidence. One exception to the warrant requirement is based on consent by a person to proceed without a warrant. Often the limit of that consent can be unclear, especially when the objects to be searched are digital devices. Recent events involving the ACLU and Michigan State Police <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> motivate the following example.</p><p>Imagine a person is stopped by police for a traffic violation and the person consents to an examination of their phone. Does this consent allow an officer to open the phone and browse through the contents of the address book or call log? Does it also extend as far as to allow the officer to use a special tool to extract and save all of the phone's information, including deleted data? The answers to these questions depend highly on the specific circumstances and the courts are inconsistent on this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Search at the U.S. customs border is another exception to the warrant requirement. This recently impacted the security community with several high profile border searches of Bradley Manning associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; see also U.S. v. Howard Cotterman, 09-10139 (2011).</p><p>There are investigators and models that have implicit exceptions to the Fourth Amendment. For example, investigators working under the U.S. national security (FISA) rules may defer a request for a warrant until after a search, and there are analogous positions in other governments. Similarly, rogue investigators can elect to not follow any restrictions, risking that collected evidence is thrown out during trial. We assert that developing new techniques to function under such models is largely wasted effort due to their limited applicability in a civil society.</p><p>Admissibility and Validity. The exclusionary rule, set forth in Weeks v. U.S., 232 U.S. <ref type="bibr">383 (1914)</ref>, in concert with the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, set forth in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. U.S., 251 U.S. <ref type="bibr">385 (1920)</ref>, dictates that illegally obtained evidence cannot be used in court, nor can any evidence further found from this illegal evidence be used. These rules ensure that techniques not valid within the plain view rules will not be commonly used by law enforcement in the U.S.</p><p>Further, we note that in the pre-warrant stage, law enforcement must take care in acquiring evidence from third parties. In addition to the problems of hearsay, even well-meaning third parties cannot repeatedly gather information for law enforcement. In doing so, the third party is acting under the color of law, and any evidence they collect is governed by the same rules as apply to law enforcement, including the need for warrants.</p><p>Another relevant ruling for computer scientists is Kyllo v. U.S. 533 U.S. <ref type="bibr">27 (2001)</ref>, where the court ruled that using a technology that is not in "general public use" to gather evidence pre-warrant is a violation of a person's expectation of privacy. This exact phrasing is important: source code available publicly on a researcher's web site is not general public use. With regard to digital forensics, this has been interpreted by investigators to mean that tools can only use information provided by normal operation of the system being investigated. Recent cases have supported this view, including U.S. v. Borowy, 595 F.3d 1045 (9th Cir. 2010) and U.S. v. Gabel, 2010 WL 3927697, but the exact extent to which can investigators can exploit a network protocol to gather information remotely is unsettled law.</p><p>In order for a forensic investigator's testimony to be admissible in court it must follow the Daubert standard; see Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579 <ref type="bibr">(1993)</ref>. According to this standard, the investigator's conclusions must be based on scientifically valid methodology. This means the methods are peer reviewed, based on testable hypotheses, have a known error rate, follow an existing set of standards, and are generally accepted within the scientific community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Civil Investigators</head><p>Our focus is on criminal forensics, and due to space limits we elide much civil case law in this section. The general rule is that there are somewhat fewer constraints and that the standard of evidence is lower, as the government is typically not using state force to prove guilt for a crime; rather, citizens seek the power of the court to discover evidence of a violation of civil law or a contract. In civil cases, examiners have complete access to their own data, including network traffic and logs, and any files where ownership or contractual agreements (e.g., files on an employee's work machine) permit access. However, examiners will need to subpoena information they are refused access to by other parties. Courts have a very low bar of relevance for subpoenaed access (see Federal Rule of Evidence 401), but this process can be adversarial. Courts may place limits on evidence acquisition if one party is concerned about legal liability from exposure of unrelated, proprietary information. Knowing this, many organizations choose not to keep data that can be subpoenaed, regardless of how useful it might be to their business.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Investigating People as a Goal</head><p>Computer security is centrally concerned with the enforcement or defeat of technically based and clearly delineated computer security policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Response to computer security failures is typically designed to identify the cause of the failure, which might provide clues to the identity of an attacker. However, intrusion response, which is familiar to security investigators, is but a small subset of digital forensics.</p><p>Forensic investigators instead often investigate suspected breaches of organizational policies or laws not reflected in any computer security policy. Indeed, such rules may be impossible to implement in a computer system. A user's intent is often relevant but impossible to determine directly. For example, a user may be allowed to copy a file for work use, but not to sell or otherwise release it. Bradley Manning's alleged theft of documents falls in this category. No existing security mechanism can directly determine intent, but an investigator may be asked to gather evidence about how and why copied files were used. Similarly, possessing photos of children likely does not violate a security policy, but having pictures of children being sexually exploited is illegal. Systems that can generalizably differentiate between the two do not exist. Furthermore, possession requires a demonstration of knowing intent: unexamined images that are unknowingly and unintentional stored in a user's spam folder are not illegal. Howard <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> provides a cogent discussion of indirect evidence of knowing possession.</p><p>Researchers must be aware of the focus on people, not just computers. Systems that answer questions about user behavior can be beneficial to forensics investigators, even if no computer security problem is being addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Applicability and Impact</head><p>Many proposed forensic techniques are easily thwarted with only limited technical knowledge, but that doesn't lessen their practical effectiveness. While security mechanisms have impact because they can address the worst case, forensic mechanisms have impact because they can address the common case. For example, the most realistic forensic model allows for any individual to erase information from storage; in this scenario, why should we expect new techniques to work at all? Surely criminals will seek to cover their tracks.</p><p>For example, investigators commonly identify images of child pornography on p2p networks by hash value. Criminals could easily change just one bit in shared images to escape detection; yet millions do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> for several reasons. First, they may not think that they need to make changes to evade investigators, or they may lack the skill to do so. Second, they may not think they'll be caught, and percentage-wise that is largely true. Third, people are interested in sharing content, and in order to do so they give files very descriptive names including "illegal child pornography"; at that point there is no legal reason to flip a bit.</p><p>Given that anyone could flip a bit but that millions do not, it is high impact to develop techniques that succeed in the common, rather than worst case. This fact is anathema to computer security researchers, even though, analogously, security systems with known flaws remain useful.</p><p>For example, despite power monitoring attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, most people do not use tamper-proof hardware. Various forms of the Sybil attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> succeed and are used against Google <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, EBay <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and p2p file sharing networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> yet these systems enjoy great success. The Tor privacy network is architected to provide reasonable performance instead of perfect security against known attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Similarly, the banking industry finds it more effective to allow "bad guys to take a cut" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> than attempting to deploy a system where all attackers are defeated. Further, the TSA admits it cannot defeat all terrorists, and instead simply mitigates risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we note that law enforcement are interested in catching the most dangerous people. Similarly, civil investigators are interested in catching the people that have caused the largest damages. In both cases, there is no evidence that such dangerousness is necessarily correlated with technical savvy. Furthermore, it is not possible for one savvy criminal to destroy, hide, or obfuscate the evidence of everyone else; in contrast, security work must consider that one person can leverage a vulnerability to attack every computer that uses the system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Lessons to Learn</head><p>In this section, we review past security papers from a forensics viewpoint. Some explicitly invoke the concept of forensics; some do so implicitly. We point out the assumptions, often limited or incorrect, made about forensics in these papers, and discuss how these assumptions limit the impact of the contributions. Our goal is not to denigrate others' contributions, but instead to show if and how these contributions fit within the forensic framework we've discussed in previous sections.</p><p>We separate our survey into several broad classes, corresponding to lessons learned about forensic practice in the previous sections: 1) Investigations are about people and their activities; 2) Forensic investigators are not all-powerful, and while the legal system can grant impressive powers, they are constrained in many ways; 3) A proposed system that depends on access to data across organizational boundaries may fail -as this access is not often permitted; 4) Proposed systems that expand the view of investigators can be useful, but simply expanding the amount of data collected by itself generally is not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair</head><p>Forensics investigations of individual's computers arise because of user's actions. Investigators are therefore most interested in people and how they used the system. Security researchers, however, tend to focus on technical aspects of security system failures. Solutions that add additional information about system events <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> tend not to benefit investigators directly. Instead, researchers can have impact by focusing on mechanisms that support common investigations types, such as theft of intellectual property, violations of organizational misuse policies, and embezzlement <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. These are common problems, and solutions will have high impact. Work in this area needs to consider the types of users who commit these acts. Most have weak computer skills, so approaches that might be trivially thwarted when used against security experts can be very effective, as we outline in Section 2.4. To paraphrase a police maxim, it is useful to catch the stupid ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Lines in the Sand</head><p>There are many clear lines lawful investigators cannot cross. Wiretapping and analogous inspection of traffic is not permitted without a warrant, nor, presumably are manipulations of Internet traffic beyond normal participation in protocols. Actively watermarking packets, by manipulating their contents or timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> to defeat anonymity systems crosses this line, and would poison the evidence acquired by a law enforcement. For civil cases, organizations might choose to use these techniques on their internal networks, but are unlikely to provide access, mark traffic, or help recover timing information for external parties. Further, many such techniques work best to confirm a suspicion, as they require both manipulation of traffic at a source, and the observation of traffic at a suspected endpoint. Evidence required for this level of suspicion may rise to the level that would lead to a warrant. But if an investigator had sufficient evidence for a warrant, a more direct search would likely be preferableif not, an electronic bug in the computer's audio system almost certainly would. As evidence ultimately supports a court case, recordings of a suspect or copies of emails would be far more useful than a watermark. Systems that assume technically sophisticated attacks, such as inference based on clock skew, temperature or power consumption changes, and acoustic or electromagnetic measurements, or packet size <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> are similarly useless to a criminal investigator, due to Kyllo, and obsolete after court order or warrant.</p><p>On the flip side, many systems are built to withstand cursory investigation, such as disk encryption systems. It is an unsettled question of law as to whether cryptographic keys are a more analogous to a physical key, which an individual can be compelled to produce in both civil and criminal courts, or to testimony, which in the criminal context is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Failing that, systems focused on key recovery can be forensically valid <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Some systems attempt to sidestep this question by providing users with plausible deniability (for example, Rubberhose and its successor TrueCrypt). These systems may be valid responses to overly intrusive governments. But they are inappropriate in more common use cases such as secure corporate record keeping, where allegations of wrongdoing will likely require court-ordered key revelation or else result in being found in contempt of court.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">No Keys to the City</head><p>Investigators working in different organizations or with different goals may not be willing or able to collaborate with one another. Sharing of data across institutional boundaries is not always feasible or even legal. Widescale intrusion or anomaly detection, de-anonymization, or flow attribution systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> that require a network-wide view or deep packet inspection are akin to a massive surveillance campaign. Monitoring of this breadth could never be lawful for law enforcement without a court order -and even then, is likely too broad in scope. These systems are still useful, outside of the criminal investigation context: ISPs or private organizations could collect this data and use it internally to improve security and performance. They cannot collect it at police request, however, as that would turn these organizations into de facto agents of the law. In many cases, it would also be unlikely that the information would be willingly shared between organizations in civil cases. This is particularly true when it might expose the organization to legal jeopardy, such as showing that it acted as a gateway or stepping stone for attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Don't Grow the Haystack; But Do Find More Needles</head><p>A system that increases the amount of information available to investigators is often a double-edged sword. The investigator may benefit from additional information, but that benefit is directly proportional to the information's quality. For example, Bratus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Piatek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> highlight how current practices in DMCA copyright enforcement focus on broad and highly automated techniques resulting in unacceptably high rates of false positives. This problem isn't just limited to p2p investigations. Clark and Landau <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> also question the utility of packet attribution in forensics. We believe their criticisms extend to other areas such as de-anonymization. Poor information may lead to tangible costs such as wasted resources or intangible costs such as emotional distress for the falsely accused.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusions</head><p>Computer security researchers have the potential to make significant contributions to digital forensics; however, they must first understand the forensics context and its differences with existing security models. Similarly, the onus is on computer security venues to support these efforts by recruiting knowledgeable reviewers who are familiar with the challenges and requirements of forensics; otherwise, the security community risks encouraging low-impact work while rejecting worthwhile solutions to forensic problems.</p></div>
			<note place="foot" n="1"> A person&apos;s expectation of privacy is established using the twopronged Katz test. The first prong asks whether the person subjectively demonstrated an expectation of privacy, and the second prong asks if that expectation is objectively reasonable from the standpoint of society; see Katz v. U.S., 389 U.S. 347 (1967).</note>

			<note place="foot" n="2"> In U.S. v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, 579 F.3d 989 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc), the Ninth Circuit imposed ex ante restrictions on warrants related to computer searches; however, recent legal scholarship suggests these restrictions are &quot;both constitutionally unauthorized and unwise&quot; [21].</note>
