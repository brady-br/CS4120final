				<p>Traditional file system optimizations typically use a one-to-one mapping of logical files to their physical metadata representations. This mapping results in missed opportunities for a class of optimizations in which such coupling is removed. We have designed, implemented, and evaluated a composite-file file system, which allows many-to-one mappings of files to metadata, and we have explored the design space of different mapping strategies. Under webserver and software development workloads, our empirical evaluation shows up to a 27% performance improvement. This result demonstrates the promise of composite files.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>File system performance optimization is a wellresearched area. However, most optimization techniques (e.g., caching, better data layout) retain the one-to-one mapping of logical files to their physical metadata representations (i.e., each file is associated with its own i-node on UNIX platforms). Such mapping is desirable because metadata constructs are deep-rooted data structures, and many storage components and mechanisms-such as VFS API <ref type="bibr">[MCK90]</ref>, prefetching, and metadata caching-rely on such constructs. However, this rigid mapping also presents a blind spot for a class of performance optimizations.</p><p>We have designed, implemented, and evaluated the composite-file file system (CFFS), where many logical files can be grouped together and associated with a single i-node (plus extra information stored as extended attributes). Such an arrangement is possible because many files accessed together share similar metadata subfields <ref type="bibr">[EDL04]</ref>, which can be deduplicated. Thus, the CFFS can yield fewer metadata accesses to storage, a source of significant overhead for accessing small files, which still dominates the majority of file references for modern workloads <ref type="bibr">[ROS00; HAR11]</ref>.</p><p>Based on web server and software development workloads, the CFFS can outperform ext4 by up to 27%, suggesting that the approach of relaxing the file-tometadata mapping is promising.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Observations</head><p>The following observations led to the CFFS design:</p><p>Frequent access to small files: <ref type="bibr">Studies [ROS00; HAR11]</ref> show that small files receive the majority of file references. Our in-house analyses of a desktop file system confirmed that &gt;80% of accesses are to files smaller than 32 bytes. Further, ~40% of the access time to access a small file on a disk can be attributable to metadata access. Thus, reducing this access overhead may lead to a large performance gain.</p><p>Redundant metadata information: A traditional file is associated with its own physical metadata, which tracks information such as the locations of file blocks, access permissions, etc. However, many files share similar file attributes, as the number of file owners, permission patterns, etc. are limited. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Edel et al. [2004]</ref> showed up to a 75% metadata compression ratio for a typical workstation. Thus, we see many opportunities to reduce redundant metadata information.</p><p>Files accessed in groups: Files tend to be accessed together, as shown by <ref type="bibr">[KRO01, LI04, DIN07, and JIA13]</ref>. For example, web access typically involves accessing many associated files. However, optimizations that exploit file grouping may not yield automatic performance gains, as the process of identifying and grouping files incurs overhead.</p><p>Limitations of prefetching: While prefetching is an effective optimization, the separate act of fetching each file and associated metadata access can impose a high overhead. For example, accessing 32 small files can incur 50% higher latency than accessing a single file with a size equal to the sum of the 32 files, even with warm caches.</p><p>This observation begs the question of whether we can improve performance by consolidating small files that are accessed together. This is achieved through our approach of decoupling the one-to-one mapping of logical files to their physical representation of metadata.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Composite-file File System</head><p>We introduce the CFFS, which allows multiple small files to be combined and share a single i-node.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Design Overview</head><p>The CFFS introduces an internal physical representation called a composite file, which holds the content of small files that are often accessed together. A composite file is invisible to end users and is associated with a single composite i-node shared among small files. The original information stored in small files' inodes are deduplicated and stored as extended attributes of a composite file. The metadata attributes of individual small files can still be reconstructed, checked, and updated, so that legacy access semantics (e.g., types, permissions, timestamps) are unchanged. The extended attributes also record the locations within the composite file for individual small files. With this representation, the CFFS can translate a physical composite file into logical files.</p><p>Which files to combine into a composite file is an important workload-dependent policy decision. As an example, the CFFS has been configured three ways. The first scheme is directory-based consolidation, where all files within a directory (excluding subdirectories) form a composite file. The second scheme is embeddedreference consolidation, where file references within file contents are extracted to identify files that can form composite files. The third is frequency-mining-based consolidation, where file references are analyzed through set frequency mining <ref type="bibr">[AGR94]</ref>, so that files that are accessed together frequently form composite files.</p><p>A composite file exploits legacy VFS prefetching mechanisms because the entire composite file may be prefetched as a unit in a similar manner to the benefit FFS achieved by combining small data blocks into fewer larger blocks <ref type="bibr">[MCK84]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Data Representation</head><p>The content of a composite file is formed by concatenating small files, referred to as subfiles. All subfiles within a composite file share the same i-node, as well as indirect blocks, doubly indirect blocks, etc. The maximum size limit of a composite file is not a concern, as composite files are designed to group small files. If the sum of subfile sizes exceeds the maximum file size limit, we can resort to the use of multiple composite files.</p><p>Often, the first subfile in a composite file is the entry point, whose access will trigger the prefetching of the remaining subfiles. For example, when a browser accesses an html file, it loads a css file and flash script. The html file can serve as the entry point and prefetching trigger of this three-subfile composite file. For the frequency-based consolidation, the ordering of subfiles reflects how they are accessed. Although the same group of files may have different access patterns with different entry points, the data layout is based on the most prevalent access pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Metadata Representations and Operations</head><p>Composite file creation: When a composite file is created, the CFFS allocates an i-node and copies and concatenates the contents of the subfiles as its data. The composite file records the composite file offsets and sizes of individual subfiles as well as their deduplicated i-node information into its extended attributes. The original subfiles then are truncated, with their directory entries remapped to the i-node of the composite file extended to also include the subfile ID and their original i-nodes deallocated. Thus, end users still perceive individual logical files in the name space, while individual subfiles can still be located <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 3</ref>.3.1).</p><p>I-node content reconstruction: Deduplicated subfile i-nodes are reconstructed on the fly. By default, a subfile's i-node field inherits the value of the composite file's i-node field, unless otherwise specified in the extended attributes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Permissions:</head><p>At file open, the permission test is first checked based on the composite i-node. If this fails, no further check is needed. Otherwise, if a subfile has a different permission stored as an extended attribute, the permission will be checked again. Therefore, the composite i-node will have the broadest permissions across all subfiles. For example, if within a composite file, we have a read-only subfile A, and a writable subfile B, the permission for the composite i-node will be readwrite. However, when opening subfile A with a write permission, the read-only permission restriction in the extended attribute will catch the violation.</p><p>Timestamps: The timestamps of individual subfiles and the composite file are updated with each file operation. However, during checks (e.g., stat system calls), we return the timestamps of the subfiles.</p><p>Sizes: For data accesses, the offsets are translated and bound-checked via subfile offsets and sizes encoded in the extended attributes. The size of a composite file is the length of the composite file, which can be greater than the total size of its subfiles. For example, if a subfile in the middle of a composite file is deleted, the region is freed, without changing the size of the composite file.</p><p>i-node namespace: For i-node numbers larger than a threshold X, upper zero-extended N bits are used for composite i-node numbers, and lower M bits are reserved for subfile IDs. We refer this range of i-node numbers as CFFS unique IDs (CUIDs).</p><p>Subfile lookups and renames: If a name in a directory is mapped to a CUID, a subfile's attributes can be looked up via the subfile ID. Renaming will proceed as if a CUID were an i-node number in a non-CFFS system. Since moving a subfile in and out of a composite file will change its CUID, we need to store backpointers <ref type="bibr">[CHI12]</ref>, to update all names mapped to the CUID. The changes in CUID may break applications (e.g., backups) that uniquely identify a file by its i-node number. However, today's file systems can also lead to different files sharing the same i-node number at different times; the CFFS design amplifies the reasons that applications should not assume that an i-node number is a unique property of a file.</p><p>Subfile and subfile membership updates: When a subfile is added to a composite file, it is appended to the composite file. When a subfile is deleted from a composite file, the corresponding data region within the composite file is marked freed in the extended attributes.</p><p>Subfile open/close operations: An open/close call to a subfile is the same as an open/close call to the composite file, with the file-position pointer translated.</p><p>Subfile write operations: In-place updates are handled the same way as those in a traditional file system. However, if an update involves growing a subfile in the middle of a composite file and no free space is available at the end of the subfile, we move the updated subfile to the end of the composite file. This scheme exploits the potential temporal locality that a growing subfile is likely to grow again in the near future.</p><p>Hardlinks: Different names in directories can be mapped to the same i-node number or CUID.</p><p>Space compaction: The composite file compacts its space when half of its allotted size contains no useful data.</p><p>Concurrent updates to subfiles within a composite file: Concurrent updates to subfiles within a composite file carry the same semantics as concurrent updates to a normal file. To avoid lock contention, files detected to be involved in concurrent updates might have to be extracted into multiple regular files.</p><p>Locking and consistency: The CFFS does not support flock, but we believe it is possible to implement a subfile locking subsystem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Identifying Composite File Membership</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Directory-based Consolidation</head><p>Given that legacy file systems have deep-rooted spatial locality optimizations revolving around directories, a directory is a good approximation of file access patterns and for forming composite files. Currently, this consolidation scheme excludes subdirectories.</p><p>The directory-based consolidation can be performed on all directories without tracking and analyzing file references. However, it will not capture file relationships across directories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Embedded-reference-based Consolidation</head><p>Embedded-reference-based consolidation identifies composite file memberships based on embedded file references in files. For example, hyperlinks may be embedded in an html file, and a web crawler is likely to access each web page via these links. In this case, we consolidate the original html file and the referenced files. Similar ideas apply to compilation. We can extract the dependency rules from Makefile and consolidate source files that lead to the generation of the same binary. As file updates may break a dependency, the CFFS could sift periodically through modified files to reconcile composite file membership.</p><p>The embedded-reference-based scheme can identify related files accessed across directories, but it may not be easy to extract embedded file references beyond textbased file formats (e.g., html, source code). In addition, it requires knowledge of specific file formats. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Frequency-mining-based Consolidation</head><p>In our exploration of a frequency-mining-based consolidation, we use a variant of the Apriori algorithm <ref type="bibr">[AGR94]</ref>. The key observation is that if a set of files is accessed frequently, its subsets must be as well (the Apriori property). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>.4.3.1 illustrates the algorithm with an access stream to files A, B, C, D, and E. Initial pass: First, we count the number of accesses for each file, and then we remove files with counts less than a threshold (say two) for further analysis.</p><p>Second pass: For the remaining files, we permute, build, and count all possible two-file reference sets. Whenever file A is accessed right after B, or vice versa, we increment the count for file set {A, B}. Sets with counts less than the threshold are removed (e.g., {B, D}).</p><p>Third pass: We can generate all three-file reference sets based on the remaining two-file reference sets. However, if a three-file reference set occurs frequently, all its two-file reference sets also need to occur frequently. Thus, file sets such as {A, B, D} are pruned, since {B, D} is eliminated in the second pass.</p><p>Termination: As we can no longer generate four-file reference sets, the algorithm ends. Now, if a file can belong to multiple file sets, we return sets {A, B, C} and {A, D} as two frequently accessed sets. Sets such as {A, B} are removed as they are subsets of {A, B, C}.</p><p>Variations: An alternative is to use a normalized threshold, or support, which is the percentage of set occurrences (number of the occurrences of a set divided by the total occurrences, ranged between 0 and 1).</p><p>Instead of tracking file sets, we can also track file reference sequences to determine the entry point and the content layout of the composite file.</p><p>We currently disallow overlapping file sets to avoid the complexity of replication and maintaining consistency. To choose a subfile's membership between two composite files, the decision depends on whether a composite file has more subfiles, higher support, and more recent creation timestamps.</p><p>The frequency-mining-based consolidation can identify composite file candidates based on dynamic file references. However, the cost of running it limits its application to more popular file reference sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Implementation</head><p>The two major components of our prototype are the composite file membership generator tool and the CFFS.</p><p>We prototyped the CFFS in user space via the FUSE (v2.9.3) framework [SZE05] <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4</ref>.1) running on top of Linux 3.16.7. The CFFS is stacked on ext4, so that we can leverage legacy tools and features such as persistence bootstrapping (e.g., file-system creation utilities), extended attributes, and journaling.</p><p>The CFFS periodically consults with the generator tool to create new composite files. We leveraged mechanisms similar to hardlinks to allow multiple file names to be mapped to the same composite i-node. We intercepted all file-system-related calls due to the need to update the timestamps of individual subfiles. We also need to ensure that various accesses use the correct permissions (e.g., open and readdir), translated subfile offsets and sizes (e.g., read and write), and timestamps (e.g., getattr and setattr). The actual composite file, its i-node, and its extended attributes are stored by the underlying ext4 file system. The CFFS is implemented in C++ with ~1,600 semicolons.</p><p>For directory-based consolidation, we used a Perl script to list all the files in a directory as composite file members. For the embedded-reference-based scheme, we focus on two scenarios. For the web server workload, we consolidate html files and their immediately referenced files. In the case of conflicting composite file memberships, preference is given to index.html, and then the html that first includes a file. The other is the source code compilation. We used Makefile as a guide to consolidate source code files. For the frequencymining-based scheme, the membership generator tool takes either a http access log or a strace output. The generator implements the Apriori algorithm, with the support parameter set to 5%. The analysis batch size is set to 50K references. The parameters were chosen based on empirical experience to limit the amount of memory and processing overhead. The generator code contains ~1,200 semicolons.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Performance Evaluation</head><p>We compared the performance of the CFFS stacked on ext4 via FUSE with the baseline ext4 file system (with the requests routed through an empty FUSE module). We evaluated our system via replaying two traces. The first is an http log gathered from our departmental web server (01/01/2015-03/18/2015). The trace contains 14M file references to 1.0TB of data; of this, 3.1M files are unique, holding 76GB of data. The second trace was gathered via strace from a software development workstation <ref type="bibr">(11/20/2014 -11/30/2014</ref>). The trace contained over 240M file-system-related system calls to 24GB of data; of this, 291,133 files are unique with 2.9GB bytes. Between read and write operations, 59% are reads, and 41% are writes.</p><p>We conducted multi-threaded, zero-think-time trace replays on a storage device. We also skipped trace intervals with no activities. The replay experiments were performed on a Dell workstation (Table 5.1). Each experiment was repeated 5 times, and results are presented at 90% confidence intervals.</p><p>Prior to each experiment, we rebuilt the file system with dummy content. For directory-and embeddedreference-based schemes, composite file memberships are updated continuously. For the frequency-miningbased consolidation, the analysis is performed in batches, but the composite files are updated daily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Web Server Trace Replay</head><p>HDD performance: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>.2.1 shows the CDF of web server request latency for a disk, measured from the time a request is sent to the time a request is completed. The original intent of our work is to reduce the number of IOs for small files that are frequently accessed together. However, the benefit of fewer accesses to consolidated metadata displays itself as metadata prefetching for all subfiles, and the composite-file semantics enable cross-file prefetching, resulting in much higher cache-hit rates.</p><p>The embedded-reference-based consolidation performed the best, with 62% of requests serviced from the cache, which is 20% higher than ext4. Thus, composite files created based on embedded references capture the access pattern more accurately. The overall replay time was also reduced by ~20%.</p><p>The directory-based composite files can also improve the cache-hit rate by 15%, reflecting the effectiveness of directories to capture spatial localities.</p><p>The frequency-mining-based consolidation performed worse than the directory-based. We examined the trace and found that 48% of references are made by crawlers, and the rest by users. Thus, the bifurcated traffic patterns for the mining algorithm form less aggressive file groupings, yielding reduced benefits.</p><p>SSD Performance: <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>.2.2 shows the CDF of web server request latency for an SSD. Compared to a disk, the relative trends are similar, with request latency times for cache misses reduced by two orders of magnitude due to the speed of the SSD. As the main performance gains are caused by higher cache-hit rates and IO avoidance, this 20% benefit is rather independent of the underlying storage media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Software Development File-system Trace Replay</head><p>For the software development workload replay, it is more difficult to capture the latency of individual filesystem call requests, as many are asynchronous (e.g., writes), and calls like mmap do not know the number of requests sent to the underlying storage. Thus, we summarize our results with overall elapsed times, which include all overheads of composite file operations, excluding the initial setup cost for the directory-and embedded-reference-based schemes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5.3.1)</ref>.</p><p>HDD performance: The embedded-reference-based scheme has poor coverage, as many references are unrelated to compilation. Therefore, the elapsed time is closer to that of ext4. Directory-based consolidation achieves a 17% elapsed time reduction, but the frequency-mining-based scheme can achieve 27% because composite files include files across directories.</p><p>SSD performance: The relative performance trend for different consolidation settings is similar to that of HDD. Similar to the web traces, the gain is up to 20%.</p><p>When comparing the performance improvement gaps between the HDD and SSD experiments, up to an 11% performance gain under HDD cannot be realized by SSD, as an SSD does not incur disk seek overheads.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Overheads</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directory-and embedded-reference-based schemes:</head><p>Directory-and embedded-reference-based schemes incur an initial deployment cost to create composite files based on directories and embedded file references. The initial cost of the embedded-reference scheme depends on the number of file types from which file references can be extracted. For our workloads, this cost is anywhere from 1 to 14 minutes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 5.3.1)</ref>.</p><p>As for the incremental cost of updating composite file memberships, adding members involves appending to the composite files. Removing members involves mostly metadata updates. A composite file is not compacted until half its allotted space is unused. As the trace replay numbers already include this overhead, this cost is offset by the benefits. Frequency-mining-based scheme: The trace gathering overhead is below 0.6%, and the memory overhead for trace analyses is within 200MB for an average of 15M lines of daily logs.</p><p>The frequency-mining-based scheme involves learning from recent file references, and it took a few replay days to reap the full benefit of this scheme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.">Discussion and Future Work</head><p>Composite files can benefit both read-dominant and read-write workloads using different storage media, suggesting that the performance gains are mostly due to the reduction in the number of IOs (~20%). The performance improvement gaps between the SSD and HDD suggest the performance gains due to reduced disk seeks and modified data layouts are up to ~10%.</p><p>Overall, we are intrigued by the relationship among ways to form composite files, the performance effects of consolidating metadata and prefetching enabled by the composite files. Future work will explore additional ways to form composite files and quantify their interplay with different components of performance contributions. Additionally, future work will more fully explore the ramifications of metadata compression, concurrency, and security.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Related Work</head><p>Small file optimizations: While our research focuses on the many-to-one mapping of logical files and physical metadata, this work is closely related to ways to optimize small file accesses by reducing the number of storage accesses. Early work on this area involve collocating a file's i-node with its first data block <ref type="bibr">[MUL84]</ref> and embedding i-nodes in directories <ref type="bibr">[GAN97]</ref> The idea of accessing subfile regions and consolidating metadata is also explored in the parallel and distributed computing domain, where CPUs on multiple computers need to access the same large data file <ref type="bibr">[YU07]</ref>. Facebook's photo storage <ref type="bibr">[BEA10]</ref> leverages the observation that the permissions of images are largely the same and can be consolidated. However, these mechanisms are tailored for very homogeneous data types. With different ways to form composite files, the CFFS can work with subfiles with more diverse content and access semantics.</p><p>Prefetching: While a large body of work can be found to improve prefetching, perhaps C-Miner <ref type="bibr">[LI04]</ref> is closest to our work. In particular, C-Miner applied frequent-sequence mining at the block level to optimize the layout of the file and metadata blocks and improve prefetching. However, the CFFS reduces the number of frequently accessed metadata blocks and avoids the need for a large table to map logical to physical blocks. In addition, our file-system-level mining deals with significantly fewer objects and associated overheads. <ref type="bibr">DiskSeen [DIN07]</ref> incorporates the knowledge of disk layout to improve prefetching, and the prefetching can cross file and metadata boundaries. The CFFS proactively reduces the number of physical metadata items and alters the storage layout to promote sequential prefetching. Soundararajan et al. <ref type="bibr">[2008]</ref> observed that by passing high-level execution contexts (e.g., thread, application ID) to the block layer, the resulting data mining can generate prefetching rules with longer runs under concurrent workloads. Since the CFFS performs data mining at the file-system level, we can use PIDs and IP addresses to detangle concurrent file references. Nevertheless, the CFFS's focus on altering the mapping of logical files to their physical representations, and it can adopt various mining algorithms to consolidate metadata and improve storage layouts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented the design, implementation, and evaluation of a composite-file file system, which explores the many-to-one mapping of logical files and metadata. The CFFS can be configured differently to identify files that are frequently accessed together, and it can consolidate their metadata. The results show up to a 27% performance improvement under two real-world workloads. The CFFS experience shows that the approach of decoupling the one-to-one mapping of files and metadata is promising and can lead to many new optimization opportunities.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Figure 3.3.1: Creation of the internal composite file (bottom) from the two original files (top).</figDesc></figure>
