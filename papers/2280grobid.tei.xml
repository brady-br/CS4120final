			<abstract>
				<p>Cyber attacks on Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) can be hugely detrimental to society, notably via compromising Industrial Control Systems (ICS) that underpin core CNI functions. In order to explore in-depth ICS Cyber Security challenges, testbeds are an essential tool, avoiding the need to experiment exclusively on live systems. However, ICS testbed creation is a complex multidisciplinary challenge, with a plethora of conflicting requirements. This paper, based on over six years of ICS testbed research and development that spans multiple diverse applications, proposes a flexible high-level model that can be adopted to support ICS testbed development. This is complemented by a baseline set of practical implementation guidance incorporating related and emerging technologies. As a collective, the model and implementation guidance offers a go-to guide for a wide range of end-users. Furthermore, it provides a coherent foundational structure towards establishing an online &quot;living&quot; resource, which can be expanded over time through broader community engagement.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Industrial Control Systems (ICS) underpin operational processes responsible for the safe continued operation of industrial facilities, some of which are classified as Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) (e.g. water and energy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref>.</p><p>To better understand the complex construct of ICSs, the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (commonly referred to as the "Purdue Model") <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[123]</ref> is often employed to provide a high-level view of fundamental features, separated into distinct zones. Cisco's enhanced version of the Purdue Model breaks down ICSs into four zones: A Safety Zone to manage safety functions; a Manufacturing Zone to monitor, control, and automate operational processes; a Demilitarised Zone providing a buffer between the Manufacturing Zone and Enterprise Zone; and finally an Enterprise Zone providing IT services and access to operational data via the Demilitarised Zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Cyber attacks targeting ICS manufacturing zones can result in widespread CNI service disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>, with risk to human life amplified through the targeting of safety zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. Therefore, attacks targeting ICSs, via increasing numbers of component vulnerabilities and exploits, presents a significant concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>. While this is recognised by ICS operators, with over three quarters surveyed believing attackers are very or quite likely to target core operations, only 23% are compliant with baseline security guidance/regulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94]</ref>.</p><p>Although legal requirements have been introduced as a mechanism to improve the cyber security posture of CNI, research is required towards the continued development of defensive techniques, providing a feedback loop into relevant supporting standards/guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>. However, the use of real-world facilities to conduct research is limited due to the impact that such activities could have on operational processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. Therefore, the use of testbeds is required. We use the term "testbed" to encompass all forms of environmental replication, including simulated, emulated, and physically replicated environments.</p><p>ICS testbeds fulfil a wide range of requirements, including research, proof-of-concepting, cyber exercising, and threat intelligence, across varying degrees of size and complexity. Through existing academic and industry engagement in this space, we have designed and built multiple ICS testbed environments to support these requirements. While existing research, including that of our own <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">80]</ref>, offers insight into the design and build of testbeds, it does not provide a clear, high-level model, accompanied by options for practical implementation, as a single go-to guide spanning a range of requirements. This paper targets such deficiencies through the identification of fundamental design considerations, and the introduction of a flexible, high-level model for ICS cyber security testbed design.</p><p>In order to take our model and deliver a testbed that supports end-user requirements, we include a baseline set of practical implementation options with supporting references. However, as it is not possible to provide a complete overview of all technical implementation options within a single publication, an incomplete picture is formed that will lose value over time. Therefore, to bolster the supporting technical implementation surrounding our model, we propose an online "living" resource, used to aggregate all practical implementation options we have applied to date. Furthermore, this acts as a foundation towards the creation of a community space which can evolve over time, with input from others who have developed ICS testbeds, thus overcoming the limitations of a single publication.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 outlines design considerations. Section 4 posits our high-level testbed model. Section 5 provides baseline options for the practical implementation of our model. Section 6 details the concept of our "living" resource. Section 7 concludes the paper and discusses areas for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Related work within this space is typically formulated around three themes: surveys, theoretical concepts, and focused example implementations.</p><p>Our early work explored the field of ICS risk management <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref>. A key finding highlighted challenges in applied methodologies, often lacking empirical evidence, described as a result of researchers' inability to access real-world data. This has resulted in the use of testbeds, a review of which revealed a broad mix of implementations. In a subsequent review of smart grid testbeds, Cintuglu et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> identified one third were developed with a cyber security focus. Holm et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref> analysed multiple implementation approaches (virtualisation, simulation, emulation, and hardware) and device coverage. Where as <ref type="bibr">Wu and Kobara [125]</ref> focused on challenges aligned to the use of simulation-based approaches alone. Finally, our more recent work examined the use of testbeds, their implementation, and evaluation processes, to extract a set of design considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>While surveys help us understand adopted approaches, they are presented at a high-level, offering little in the way of guidance to support practical testbed development. Work presenting conceptual viewpoints begins to address this issue. Christiansson and Luiijf <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> discussed the concept of a European ICS security testbed from multiple perspectives (strategy, potential problems, end requirements, etc.). Our foundational work <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">80]</ref> defined key concepts for ICS testbed design, centralised around flexibility, credibility, reliability, and diversity. Design considerations have been discussed by Joonsoo et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref> for cyber exercise testbeds, and Maynard et al., for experimental testbeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref>. These are comparable to our more recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, extended by Craggs et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> to produce a reference architecture. Alternative reference architectures have also been proposed by <ref type="bibr">Kavallieratos et al., [52]</ref> and Giani et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>. Rigid concepts based on how the authors have developed their own facilities can result in a lack of depth, and offer limited details for practical implementation. From our experience, a form of tunnel vision can emerge, resulting in discussion aligned to a single approach.</p><p>Work focusing on implementation typically aligns to specific approaches, also resulting in a narrow viewpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Focusing on large-scale deployments are little more than aspirational for most, with insufficient detail for end-to-end replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref>. The use of network diagrams, associated devices, protocols, etc., begin to bridge the gap, however they are highly rigid <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This is reflected in our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref>, where details were provided within the context of lessons learnt and aligned to a network diagram, presenting a challenge if used as a sole reference.</p><p>The existing work described in this section is largely limited due to its focus on rigid theoretical concepts and highly focused implementations. The remainder of this paper will leverage existing resources one should consult prior to the use of our flexible, high-level model. Our model will be complemented with a set of baseline implementation options, and the introduction of an online living resource, aiding in the practical development of testbeds to meet end-user requirements. Collectively, this will address the challenges identified across existing work, and better support the security community towards the continued development and evolution of ICS testbeds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Design Considerations</head><p>ICS testbed development can be complex. It is therefore essential to clearly define and follow a set of design considerations aligned to specific end-user requirements, while remaining mindful of how such requirements may change over time.</p><p>Existing work details a broad selection of design considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">80]</ref>. However our recent survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> offers the most comprehensive overview to date. This work provides a set of characteristics (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) one should consider when outlining testbed objectives (TBO), architecture (TBA), and/or evaluation process (TBE The value placed on each characteristic should be driven by end-user requirements. For example, the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[111]</ref> provides a set of security assessment principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[110]</ref> operators must incorporate into their systems and processes. This involves a requirement for exercising established processes, using live scenarios where practical. Dependent upon exercise aims, developing a comprehensive testbed across each characteristic may not be necessary. For example, where the focus of an exercise is aligned to human response, a testbed's fidelity requirements would typically be lower than an exercise focusing on the use of security tooling.</p><p>As a research tool, the diversity of systems, for example, becomes less of a concern when undertaking research on devices from a single vendor <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref>. Compared to monitoring and logging capability, of utmost importance providing data capture capabilities for further analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[97]</ref>.</p><p>Industry based proof-of-concept/system trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[81]</ref>, as with testbeds for research purposes, can be highly focused. The implementation/testing of an intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) supporting a selection of industrial protocols, for example. This could dictate a requirement for the diversity of equipment to generate network traffic, while increasing fidelity by avoiding simulation techniques.</p><p>Threat intelligence, as demonstrated by a recent Honeypot implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>, further highlights the importance of building upon relevant characteristics. This work focused heavily on fidelity, in an attempt to attract real-worlds threat actors. The addition of broad interoperability and modularity, for example, would not have provided significant benefits given this defined objective.</p><p>The characteristics listed here should be reviewed as an initial step in forming an understanding of testbed design requirements. The following section introduces our flexible, high-level model, used to provide a stepping stone from design requirements to practical implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">High-Level Model</head><p>Work on ICS testbeds to date has focused on the design and implementation of specific architectural or device-level constructs. While this provides value, it is often too rigid and narrow in focus to support broader goals, differing levels of technical expertise, varying budgets, etc. This section introduces our high-level model, abstracted from rigid architectures, much the same way as the Purdue Model abstracts from real-world ICS deployments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> provides a graphical representation of our model. As an abstract resource, its use is non-prescriptive, supporting the understanding and selection of appropriate features to deliver against testbed requirements. The following subsections describe each of the model's five layers. These layers are supported by a safety and security wraparound, representing a key requirement for any testbed, ensuring end-user safety is upheld, and the testbed is protected from unauthorised access and disruption. The Cyber Security Experiment Lifecycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref> and its four core elements (Design, Instantiation, Execution, and Analysis) will be used to augment layer descriptions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Management Layer</head><p>The Management Layer acts as central point from which oversight of a testbed can be established. This includes general functionality, from server management to network management, but extends to include the safety and security wraparound. Experiment Instantiation and Execution is partially covered by this layer. For example, management access to a hypervisor <ref type="bibr">[122]</ref> can be used to deploy virtual machines within the Experimental Layer as per experiment Design requirements. If deployed in isolation from other layers as per our model, a clear demarcation between usable infrastructure and operational oversight can be established, meaning management activities are undertaken in complete isolation from experiment activities. However, this may not be practical in smaller deployments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">User Layer</head><p>The User Layer presents an opportunity to centralise and manage a set of resources, which testbed users may require to support experiment Design, and to capture and Analyse experiment data. The functionality of this layer can be viewed as the management of experiment tooling and systems with visibility over/access to the Experimental Layer. Therefore, experiment Instantiation and Execution are also supported by this layer through access into the Experimental Layer via the Infrastructure Bridge. For example, this could include accessing Experimental Layer devices, configuring, enabling, and orchestrating (Executing) their operation as per experiment Design requirements. This layer may take many forms, particularly in smaller deployments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Infrastructure Bridge</head><p>The Infrastructure Bridge provides a network infrastructure to control the flow of data between the User Layer and the Experimental Layer, supporting experimental Instantiation and Execution from the User Layer. This can be of benefit when conducting high-risk research within the Experimental Layer, limiting the spread of malicious artefacts onto User Layer systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Experimental Layer</head><p>Forming the core element of any ICS testbed is the Experimental Layer, where all ICS components are deployed supporting experiment Instantiation and Execution as per associated Design requirements. Considering the Purdue Model as a highlevel representation of ICS components, the Experimental Layer is where these are deployed. In addition to ICSs, we also consider related and emerging technologies encroaching into the ICS space. This includes Building Management Systems (BMS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). As this model is designed to support cyber security testbed design, additional related systems may also be required here, Security Operations Centres (SOC) for example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Remote Access Layer</head><p>Based on the size and access requirements, a Remote Access Layer can be implemented accommodating interconnectivity for external Experimental Layers (e.g. partner organisations, mobile facilities, and remote worker simulation), external User Layer access, and remote Management Layer access, supporting all elements of the experiment lifecycle. Where one may participate in a larger federated set of testbeds between a group of partnering organisations, it could be that our model is singular, with remote external experimental platforms all managed within one holistic environment. Alternatively, each member may operate every layer of our model independently, and share Experimental Layer resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Summary</head><p>With the exception of the Experimental Layer, not all of the aforementioned model layers will be required within every testbed, much like each level of the Purdue Model and realworld ICS deployments. This is an important point to note, with the subsequent section applying our model as a foundation, and detailing specific attributes one can align to each layer should they be required.</p><p>To provide a bridge between our model and baseline practical implementation details, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> has been created to depict optional building blocks one may wish to consider implementing across each layer within the model. Here you can also see how the practical management of a safety and security wraparound falls within the scope of the management layer. As with the general management of core testbed elements, overarching safety and security properties should remain largely invisible to testbed users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Baseline Practical Implementation</head><p>The following subsections take our model layers and constituent building blocks from <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, to offer baseline practical implementation options. As discussed in Section 2, existing work providing details towards practical implementation techniques are highly focused on how the authors have built their own facilities. Here, we take existing academic work, commercial products, open-source tooling, programming libraries, personal experience, etc. to offer a broad range of practical implementation options, spanning all model layers.</p><p>As discussed across the previous sections, the practical implementation guidance provided here offers a baseline, and is structurally aligned the model breakdown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. This provides a starting point towards the practical development of an ICS testbed, but more importantly, demonstrates the type of information an online living resource could contain, this will be discussed further in Section 6.</p><p>Due to the practical nature of this section, we have also created <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> depicting an example network architecture aligned to our model. As with <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, this is included to stimulate and support discussion. This is not a mandated practical application of the model. Additional practical network architectures for ICS environments can be found in documentation by NIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[107]</ref> and Kaspersky Labs <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Management Layer</head><p>The following section details practical implementation techniques for elements within the Management Layer. When developing this layer it is important to consider all elements that underpin the testbed, and how they can be managed in isolation from other layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">User Access Control</head><p>The Management Layer underpins all testbed capability. As such, user access control forms a critical component, allowing authorised testbed managers to make changes supporting user requirements at a physical and virtual level.</p><p>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[127]</ref> via Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, can be used as a centralised point for authentication with physical or virtualised computational resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[116]</ref>, network devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, etc.</p><p>For physical access control, one can refer to guidance provided by CPNI <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Computational Resource Management</head><p>The implementation of desktop and server based instances, running across each layer of a testbed, can be physical or virtual. As per <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, the management layer could be deployed as a single network zone with all physical devices connected allowing for wide-spread access.</p><p>Where virtualisation is adopted, a single physical host running numerous virtual hosts will be established. A dedicated network interface must be allocated for setup/ongoing management. Taking vSphere (ESXI) <ref type="bibr">[122]</ref> as an example, should an environment require more than one physical host, vCentre <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[119]</ref> can be used to centrally manage all vSphere instances. vSphere and vCentre also provides APIs for the development of custom tooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[121]</ref>.</p><p>Non-virtualised physical deployments may require a dedicated network interface, with an appropriate service enabling system-level access. This could be something as simple as RDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref> or SSH <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Broader server and infrastructure monitoring tools including Splunk <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[105]</ref> may also provide benefits for larger deployments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Network Resource Management</head><p>When accessing independent network devices, a dedicated network interface for use on the management layer could be adopted. Alternatively an IP to console server may be more cost-effective and prevent unwanted bridging <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[75]</ref>.</p><p>The use of VLANs offers multiple benefits, particularly in virtualised environments <ref type="bibr">[120]</ref>. Network connections can be passed via a centralised switch, collecting all VLANs and feeding them via a single trunk to a virtualisation server/s. The use of a centralised switch also provides a single point of contact to isolate network zones, supports the ability to switch between a physical and SDN based implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>, establish mirrored data feeds from specific ports <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, etc.</p><p>Building a digital twin of the network infrastructure using tools such as Packet Tracer <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> can support change management processes. In addition, general networking monitoring tools including Nagios <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref> may also provide value.</p><p>We have also included a Hand-Off router in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. This could be used to manage all external connectivity, with well structured static routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, access control lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, intrusion detection/prevention (IDS/IPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, etc. The separation between a public facing router managing encrypted external connectivity, and the non-encrypted internal network, allows for a greater level of visibility into traffic flows (IPs, ports, protocols, etc.) for a IDS/IPS to analyse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4">Process and Safety</head><p>A set of devices and processes may be required to feed Experimental Layer systems with data. The use of these must be controlled, ensuring users are safe from physical harm at all times. Mandating testbed users undertake basic electrical safety training <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[108]</ref>, follow wiring recommendations including power separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[88]</ref>, and encase all live equipment in suitable panels <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[106]</ref>, can act as a starting point supporting this critical requirements.</p><p>Out-of-loop safety systems, with a security wraparound (see Section 5.1.5) preventing unauthorised command execution between systems could also be employed, much the same as real-world safety systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">85]</ref>. Additional formal guidance is available in related standards, including ISO 62061 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The use of remote resources should be conducted under a strict set of procedures agreed between both parties. Cameras may also add value, providing a secondary verification of process states. This can be summarised as a holistic sociotechnical view, with blended safety and security controls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.5">Security Monitoring</head><p>With the Management Layer acting as a gate-keeper to all testbed resources, security monitoring falls within its scope, ensuring testbed compromise by unauthorised persons is not realised, and experimentation is appropriately isolated. Concepts used in the development of a Security Operations Centre (SOC) within the Experimental Layer could be applied here (see Section 5.5.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Infrastructure Bridge Layer</head><p>This layer performs one task, supporting connectivity between the User Layer, and the Experimental Layer. Using <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> as an example, this can be as simple as including one router and subnet onto which devices in both layers connect. In practical terms, this means a workstation in the User Layer will have two interfaces, one in the User Layer network, the other in the Infrastructure Bridge Layer network. Likewise, a workstation in the Experimental Layer will have two interfaces, one in an Experimental Layer network, the other in the Infrastructure Bridge Layer network. This is where Experimental Layer networks can be complex; it is essential that the devices communicate with one another over their respective experimental network subnets, rather than over the Infrastructure Bridge network. This can be managed through the introduction of local firewalls permitting connectivity with user layer devices only <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">115]</ref>. Further complexity and additional networking components could be added to the Infrastructure Bridge Layer, to manage User Layer access to Experimental Layer resources beyond the baseline described here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">User Layer</head><p>The following subsections provide a breakdown of each element within the User Layer. When developing this layer, it is important to consider all elements and tooling that testbed users may require to conduct their work, reducing the need for additional bolt-on systems and services which could impact the testbeds overall manageability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Workstations</head><p>Including workstations (physical or virtual) in a User Layer allows for the integration of all supporting hardware and software as a centralised resource pool. These workstations could be Windows or Linux based, dependent upon requirements. For example, the Kali Linux distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[96]</ref> comes pre-built with a number of tools that testbed users may require. Additional tools could include network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[124]</ref>, scripting <ref type="bibr">[87]</ref>, reverse engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, debugging <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref>, and ICS vendor software <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[102]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">User Access Control</head><p>The use of physical and virtual workstations within the User Layer allows for scalability and the integration of local experimental devices (see Section 5.3.7), storage, data capture points, etc. User access control to these resources is critical, particularly where parallel activities may be under way across the Experimental Layer. The approaches described within Section 5.1.1 are applicable here, centralising the management of resources based on user profiles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Jump Box</head><p>Jump boxes represent a central point from which system users access the Experimental Layer via the Infrastructure Bridge Layer (with a network interface sitting on each network as described in Section 5.2). Authentication with a jump box via approaches described in Section 5.1.1 would also be appropriate here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.4">Storage</head><p>The data generated by user experiments may require substantial storage capacity. While user workstations (physical or virtual) may have sufficient internal capacity, data management is key. The approaches described within Section 5.1.1 can be used to manage resources on a user-by-user basis. Additional storage can be implemented through the use of external devices, with platforms such as vSphere affording seamless integration of iSCSI devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[117]</ref> and network attached storage <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[118]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.5">Network Data Capture</head><p>Network data capture is typically achieved through the use of network mirrors/spans. Section 5.1.3 described the use of a centralised network switch. Implementing an approach such as this, where every network connection passes through a centralised switch, allows all associated traffic to be captured.</p><p>Where switches reside beyond the core network, within each field site for example (see Section 5.5.1), having them feed back to a centralised switch would also offer significant value. In order to provide ease of access to mirrored/span traffic, VLANS can be used. Aligning each link to a specific VLAN and trunking it to a centralised location, such as vSphere, allows for User Layer workstations to be mapped to specific VLANS, affording visibility of all associated traffic with appropriate tooling (e.g. Wireshark <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[124]</ref>). This supports a critical requirement of testbed users in the analysis of holistic network traffic. Furthermore, this traffic can also be fed into SOC systems (see Section 5.5.4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.6">Process Data Capture</head><p>The ability to access data from operational processes deployed across the Experimental Layer from the User Layer, may be required to validate results seen directly within the Experimental Layer itself. Using software defined radio (SDR) technologies, researchers can capture radio traffic from wireless sensor network devices (see Section 5.3.7). This can be used in collaboration with network data captures (see Section 5.3.5) to validate operational process sates. The use of cameras to monitor physical operational processes can also further validation efforts. In addition, a more comprehensive option would be to deploy secondary sensors and controllers within the User Layer, providing a guaranteed view of operational process states where Experimental Layer devices are under attack. Should an out-of-loop safety system be deployed as part of the Management Layer (see Section 5.1.4), exporting its data for use in the User Layer could present an alternate option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.7">Local Experimental Devices</head><p>In order to capture certain data types, or interact with aspects of the Experimental Layer, particularly with wireless technologies, testbed users will need to implement additional, specialised hardware. This could include SDR, WiFi, Bluetooth, and Infra-Red. For example, a Blade RF <ref type="bibr">[74]</ref> could be deployed in the User Layer to support SDR capabilities. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> provides an example of integrating external connectivity with a testbed environment. Here a single, public facing router is depicted, which would be used to aggregate all external connectivity into the testbed. This router could act as a traditional, centralised VPN connection point for all external connectivity, adopting a "hub-and-spoke" architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Alternatively, a single tunnel to a centralised platform such as Perimeter 81 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> can be used to managed all external connectivity. In this model, Perimeter 81 acts as the public facing entry point into the testbed, supporting static VPN and desktop-based client connectivity models. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> also includes a hand-off router; this can be used to introduce an additional layer between external and internal systems, with an open link between it and the public facing router (non-encrypted traffic that can be analysed by an IDS/IPS system). In this example, the hand-off would be responsible for access into each testbed layer. Access to the Management Layer represents the greatest risk, where an additional level of authentication between the hand-off and management router may be required. For external user access, directly reachable devices could be limited to User Layer workstations. Experimental Layer access can become more complicated dependent upon requirements. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> provides three example paths, one as a simulated user (mimicking a real-world operator of the ICS infrastructure), one as a remote field site (providing an entire external network of systems), and one as a single remote device being introduced into an existing area of the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Remote Access Layer</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Experimental Layer</head><p>The following subsections provide a breakdown of each element within the experimental layer. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> provides a more comprehensive picture of how the replicated ICS infrastructure could look, acting as an additional example reference point throughout this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.1">ICS</head><p>When developing core ICS elements of the Experimental Layer, an appropriate network architecture should be selected, onto which appropriate devices and software packages can be deployed. Resources including NIST 800-82 <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[107]</ref> can be referenced for practical examples of ICS architectures found in real-world environments. An additional example of this can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, where a selection of network zones have been defined.</p><p>While each operational ICS deployment is unique, adopted hardware and software is similar, varying in scale and complexity to meet operational requirements. To support our discussion, examples are provided spanning core zones within the previously described "extended" Purdue Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, with the Manufacturing Zone and Demilitarised Zone grouped for simplicity. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> the "Local/Remote FS" networks represent geographically dispersed field sites (water treatment works, pumping stations, etc.) that form the foundation of any Manufacturing Zone, the "Operational Technology (OT)" networks represent elements of the Manufacturing Zone and Demilitarised Zone, and the "Information Technology (IT)" networks represent elements of the Enterprise Zone.</p><p>Manufacturing Zone and Demilitarised Zone: The physical operational process resides at the lowest level of an ICS. There are two primary options for process replication, physical and virtual. A physical self-build can be conducted based on existing documented approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[89]</ref>. Alternatively, two off-the-shelf options are available: large scale processes that operate in the same way as real-world systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>, or mini replication kits <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. Simulated options are available both commercially <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and as open-sourced projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, or can be self developed through the use of communications libraries supporting common industrial protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) and Remote Terminal Units (RTU) represent the heart of manufacturing zone activities, providing direct interaction with operational processes delivering monitoring, control, and automation capability. Physical devices can be procured from leading vendors including Rockwell <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[91]</ref> . Some also offer starter kits with all relevant supporting configuration software and Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[99]</ref>. Alternatively, commercial PLC simulation software is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[103]</ref>, or the aforementioned library <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref> could be used to self develop a simulated controller, with the option of physical I/O through microcontroller development boards/single board computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>HMIs used to monitor and control operational processes via PLCs are bundled within starter kits. They can also be procured separately in a range of sizes from leading vendors including Rockwell <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref> . Within larger-scale deployments these devices are replaced with desktop-based software alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[101]</ref>. The aforementioned library could also be used to self develop a HMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>.</p><p>Historian software used to collect data for analytical purposes is available from leading vendors, including Kepware <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref> . Once again, the aforementioned libraries could be used to self develop a historian <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>, with the addition of supplementary libraries supporting protocols for connectivity with datacentre/cloud based systems (e.g. OPC <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[79]</ref> ).</p><p>When considering data-centre based environments aggregating data from multiple field sites, commercial solutions are available from leading vendors, including <ref type="bibr">Schneider [31]</ref>, that may also include demo licensing options. Open sourced options are also available, including RapidSCADA <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[93]</ref> . Moving into the IoT/IIoT space, products from Thingworx <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref> offer additional benefits, such as cloud-based operation, and increased interconnectivity with a wider variety of devices, such as those noted in Section 5.5.3. Finally, as with the aforementioned examples, existing libraries can be used to self develop systems of this nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">79]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to the ICS focused packages described here, the inclusion of more generic network and user management systems discussed across previous sections could also be deployed. Security monitoring capability forms an additional key consideration, see Section 5.5.4 for related implementation details.</p><p>Enterprise Zone: The Enterprise Zone largely contains common IT-based system, from general user workstations, to email servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>, file share servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref>, and update servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>. However, the inclusion of bespoke software packages to interface with Demilitarised Zone systems may also required. For example, a mirror of Schneider's ClearSCADA platform could be deployed in the Demilitarised Zone (isolated away from broader field-site connectivity utilised by a primary ClearSCADA server) to provide Enterprise Zone access to operational data. This platform can be accessed via a web-interface, or with a client application <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. In addition, the inclusion of Internet connectivity within this zone would be common in real-world scenarios. Where direct connectivity to the Internet is less desirable, simulated alternatives are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref>. As with the Demilitarised Zone, the inclusion of generic network, user management, and security systems discussed throughout this paper could also be deployed here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.2">BMS</head><p>BMSs are traditionally abstracted and divided into 3 zones: the Field Zone, the Automation Zone, and the Management Zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. We use these three zones to breakdown discussions here. As previously described, BMSs are related to ICS, therefore may be of interest to testbed users. Both BMS and IoT systems could be deployed in a single isolated network zone, or become fully integrated into core ICS elements of the Experimental Layer.</p><p>Field Zone: This zone is where physical elements under the BMSs control reside. These include Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting, fire and smoke detection, and access control. Physical elements can be deployed as large-scale real-world systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, scaled down replications <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, or simulated using field-level communication protocol libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[83]</ref> used to communicate with Automation Zone devices.</p><p>Automation Zone: Controllers form the core component of this zone, providing an interface to monitor, control, and automate operational processes, similar to PLCs and RTUs in ICSs. Physical devices can be procured from leading vendors such as Trend Controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[112]</ref>. Some ICS vendors also provide BMS-specific devices, including Siemens <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[100]</ref> . Alternatively controllers can be self developed using microcontroller development boards/single board computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, or virtualised using protocol libraries for communications between the Field Zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[83]</ref> and the Management Zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Management Zone: Data aggregation from all controllers can be centralised for supervision, monitoring, and logging purposes within this zone. Traditionally, this is developed as a supervisory server <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[113]</ref> with direct network access to controllers and a historian server <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Additional engineering workstations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, HMIs, and backup servers may also feature in this zone dependent upon operational requirements. Supervision servers are often proprietary, this can lead to wider compatibility issues. To address this issue, and to better unify BMSs, Tridium's Niagara Fox <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[114]</ref> uses add-ons (drivers) to communicate with a broad range of vendor devices using both open-source and proprietary protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.3">IoT</head><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is vastly heterogeneous <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with devices and solutions being developed and deployed for seemingly every conceivable application <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. There are many different architectures available for IoT, however for the purposes of implementation within the Experimental Layer, the following commonly utilised 3-tiered architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is used to separate and guide relevant discussion: Perception Zone, Network Zone, and Application Zone.</p><p>Perception Zone: This zone consists of devices used to sense and interact with their surrounding environments. Physical devices can be procured from leading vendors including Yale <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[126]</ref>, or can be self developed using open source kits <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[77]</ref>. Commercial simulation options are also available <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Network Zone: IoT devices use a variety of network protocols. Devices that are computationally constrained use bespoke protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[104]</ref>, compared to gateways and less computationally constrained devices operating over standardised/conventional protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref>. There exist both commercial <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[98]</ref> and open source <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[78]</ref> solutions supporting a variety of IoT communication protocols. Simulation of these is also made possible through commercial products <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[109]</ref> and programming libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[82]</ref>.</p><p>Application Zone: This zone contains traditional and nontraditional devices aggregating and utilising generated data. Implementations available within this zone vary greatly, and are largely depend on the given application area. For example, there are both commercial <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[92]</ref> and open source <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[76]</ref> solutions available for home automation. In-house development of IoT solutions within this space is achievable, with libraries available to support communication using related IoT protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref>. Virtual application development and testing is also available commercially <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5.4">SOC</head><p>The Security Operations Centre (SOC), within the Experimental Layer, is intended to support attack detection, centralised security monitoring, and analysis during experimentation. Data ingested and analysed by the SOC can be split into two domains, endpoint and network. Endpoint data is captured from desktop and server based systems throughout the Experimental Layer via the use of installed agents, configured to feed back crucial information such as processes, communications, and user logins to the SOC's server. There are numerous options for endpoint monitoring and detection, such as AT&amp;T's AlienVault Unified Security Management <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The inclusion of network data into the SOC allows for a more holistic view, and provides better coverage over devices on which endpoint agents cannot be installed. Network traffic, captured from network mirrors/spans in the Experimental Layer (see Section 5.3.5), can be fed into the existing SOC server to be parsed. However, one may have more success passing the network traffic to specialised devices capable of ICS, BMS, and IoT protocol recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6">Layer Agnostic</head><p>Systems built with a diverse toolset can be deployed across multiple testbed layers to perform a range of tasks, from maintenance to experimentation. For example, a Kali Linux <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[96]</ref> system can provide adversary simulation in the Experimental Layer, capture and analyse network traffic in the User Layer, and undertake routine offensive security testing of the testbed's own defences in the Management Layer. Access to ICS device configuration/programming software across testbed layers may also form a key requirement, and where licenses are tied to a single system, continued re-deployment of systems between layers becomes critical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Living Resource</head><p>The previous sections have taken our high-level model and transformed it first into a set of building blocks <ref type="figure">(Figure 2)</ref>, then baseline practical implementation guidance. While this provides a starting point for those looking to build/enhance their own testbed environments, due to page limitations it becomes infeasible to detail all options towards the practical development of a testbed. Furthermore, as a publication ages over time, the relevance and value of its associated practical guidance is devalued.</p><p>Using our model and the initially proposed set of constituent building blocks, Section 5's baseline implementation guidance set provides a clear foundational structure onto which additional information can be added over time. We therefore present the concept of an online "living" resource for ICS testbed development, currently hosted publicly on GitHub <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. This resource is currently presented as a web page and is structured in alignment to Section 5, including introductory definitions of the model and its associated layers. Taking the practical guidance from Section 5 as a base, we have added additional details and references based on our own research and experience in testbed development. This demonstrates added value brought to the security community through a potentially limitless living resource, which has the ability to grow and evolve over time.</p><p>While the current living resource offers additional value in its current form, it is based on the research and experience of those within the Security Lancaster research institute. This presents a limiting factor. To overcome this limitation, we aim to build an open information sharing community to support its continued development. Initially, this will be through a dedicated mailbox to which other testbed owners can submit suggestions for new building blocks across each layer (an extension of <ref type="figure">Figure 2)</ref>, and/or accompanying practical implementation guidance.</p><p>Security Lancaster is in the process of deploying TIDE-H (Threat Intelligence Data Exchange Hub) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. TIDE-H will act as a central repository for datasets spanning a range of security themes, one of which ties directly to ICSs, making it an ideal platform for a more interactive community to be housed (beyond a simple mailbox). Furthermore, it allows for the integration and sharing of additional ICS testbed artefacts (configuration files, network traffic captures, tooling, etc.).</p><p>The formation of TIDE-H also enables broader integration with other information sharing hubs, such as SEARCCH (due to launch in Summer 2020) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[95]</ref>, thus supporting the growth of a broader community-driven space within the context of cyber security research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>ICS testbeds are fast becoming an essential tool for the indepth exploration of cyber security challenges towards the protection of CNI. As an extension of existing work in this space, we have introduced a flexible high-level model used to support the design and development of ICS testbeds, accompanied by baseline practical implementation options. Collectively we have provided a set of building blocks the cyber security community can adopt to shape their own testbed environments.</p><p>In aligning discussions to our proposed model, we have illustrated its non-prescriptive application, similar to the Purdue model in real world deployments. Acting as a supporting structure, our model can be built upon based on end-user requirements. To further the value of our model and baseline practical implementation options, we have established an online living resource, initially offering additional practical implementation options based on our own research and experience within this field. This resource forms the foundations of a community-driven effort, where additional building blocks can be added to our high-level model, along with associated practical implementation guidance.</p><p>Since the creation of our model, we have rebuilt Lancaster University's ICS testbed to support each layer. This has improved the usability of our testbed, with lower barriers to entry for new users, and enabled a broader set of concurrent research activities to be undertaken. In addition, we are using the model to support testbed design for industry-driven product evaluation activities.</p><p>Future work will look to port our initial living online resource into the TIDE-H platform. Our vision is that this living resource provides a foundation towards the creation of a community-driven, evolving implementation guide, but more than that, allows for additional testbed artefacts and data repositories to be shared within the community. Furthermore, with community support comes the ability to further validate our model across a range of application domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: High-Level Model</figDesc></figure>
