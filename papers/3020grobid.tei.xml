				<p>The emergence of Hybrid Shingled Magnetic Recording (H-SMR) allows dynamic conversion of the recording format between Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) and SMR on a single disk drive. H-SMR is promising for its ability to manage the performance/capacity trade-off on the disk platters and to adaptively support different application scenarios in large-scale storage systems. However, there is little research on how to efficiently manage data and space in such H-SMR drives. In this paper, we present ZoneAlloy, an elastic data and space management scheme for H-SMR drives, to explore the benefit of using such drives. ZoneAlloy initially allocates CMR space for the application and then gradually converts the disk format from CMR to SMR to create more space for the application. ZoneAlloy controls the overhead of the format conversion on the application I/O with our quantized migration mechanism. When data is stored in an SMR area, ZoneAlloy reduces the SMR update overhead using H-Buffer and Zone-Swap. H-Buffer is a small host-controlled CMR space that absorbs the SMR updates and migrates those updates back to the SMR space in batches to bring down the SMR update cost. Zone-Swap dynamically swaps &quot;hot&quot; data from the SMR space to the CMR space to further alleviate the SMR update problem. Evaluation results based on MSR-Cambridge traces demonstrate that ZoneAlloy can reduce the average I/O latency and limit the performance degradation of the application I/O during format conversion.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>With ever-increasing demand on storage capacity, Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology was introduced where disk tracks are overlapped in a shingled fashion to achieve higher areal density on the same disk platter compared to Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR). However, the increased capacity of SMR comes with the price that updates to these SMR tracks will cause expensive read-modify-write overhead (which we also call SMR update overhead). Recently, Google introduced the idea of Hybrid SMR (H-SMR, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) drives <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A single H-SMR drive can have both CMR and SMR areas, and the format can be changed from one type to the other using the H-SMR APIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. H-SMR drives are capable of balancing the IOPS and the capacity potential of the disk platters. Moreover, the configuration of the CMR and SMR areas in H-SMR drives can be adjusted dynamically. Therefore, H-SMR are more flexible than solutions that have a fixed number of CMR/SMR tracks.</p><p>H-SMR enables us to better utilize the drives based on the different properties of CMR and SMR. As the H-SMR drive is initially formatted into all CMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, an intuitive approach is to store as much data as possible in CMR areas without introducing any SMR update overhead. If the data grows beyond the full CMR capacity, we can gradually convert the disk format from CMR to SMR for larger capacity.</p><p>However, there are still many challenges before we can fully utilize these H-SMR drives; e.g., how to arrange the format layout and place data accordingly, how to perform format conversion efficiently, how to reduce SMR update overhead, and how to adapt to dynamic workloads. To the best of our knowledge, there is little investigation on how to deal with these problems in order to use these H-SMR drives efficiently.</p><p>In this paper, we propose ZoneAlloy, an elastic data and space management scheme for H-SMR drives to address the aforementioned challenges <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. ZoneAlloy hides the H-SMR details and presents upper layer applications with an elastic data space, i.e., an address space with extendable size. When data is stored in SMR format, ZoneAlloy can also alleviate the SMR update overhead under dynamic I/O patterns.</p><p>To support the extendable address space, ZoneAlloy has a zone-mapping that translates the address from the elastic  data space to the disk space. There is also a two-phase elastic allocation scheme to fulfill the space extension request by initially allocating CMR space and then converting the disk format from CMR to SMR as necessary ( ยง3.1). Because the conversion operation is expensive for the application due to the intensive valid data migration, we propose a quantized migration mechanism ( ยง3.2) in ZoneAlloy that is able to control the impact of the conversion operation on the application I/O workload.</p><p>In addition, to mitigate the SMR update overhead, we propose H-Buffer and Zone-Swap in ZoneAlloy. H-Buffer (Hostcontrolled Buffer, ยง3.3) is a small CMR space that can buffer the SMR updates and migrate the buffered data back to the SMR space in batches to reduce the SMR update overhead. Zone-Swap ( ยง3.4) can identify and exchange "hot" data in SMR space with "cold" data in CMR space to further alleviate the SMR read-modify-write overhead.</p><p>Evaluations using MSR-Cambridge traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> show that ZoneAlloy outperforms baseline schemes in average latency and can finish the format conversion efficiently with controllable impact on the application I/O performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Hybrid SMR Preliminaries</head><p>In the hybrid SMR API <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, the same physical media can be formatted into either CMR zones or SMR zones, where a zone is a consecutive LBA space with a size of 256MiB. Each SMR zone has a write pointer indicating where the next write should go to enforce sequential write. Following the most popular Host-Managed SMR model <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, the host cannot directly write to the addresses other than the write pointer's location. Therefore, for SMR updates which are not targeted to the write pointer's location, existing data in the SMR zone needs to be read out, combined with the updates, and written back again, causing serious SMR update overhead.</p><p>Logical disk space of an Hybrid SMR drive is partitioned into the CMR domain (lower address space) and the SMR domain (higher address space) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the host can convert any number of consecutive zones from one format to the other with the H-SMR APIs, which takes an extent of zones from one domain offline and brings the corresponding zones in the other domain online. Here "online" means the zone is backed with the physical disk space, and vice versa. Due to the different areal density of CMR and SMR, the number of zones will usually be different from that before the conversion. For example, supposing a hypothetical SMR to CMR areal density ratio of 1.5:1, 2GiB of CMR space (8 zones) could be typically converted into 3GiB of SMR space (12 zones). Note that these APIs will destroy the stored data in the zones being converted, thus the host is responsible for protecting the valid data in these zones.</p><p>We define format conversion, or conversion, as the procedure where the host changes some disk space format from CMR to SMR for more capacity. A conversion comprises of two operations: valid data migration and H-SMR API invocation. For example, when converting 2GiB of CMR space, valid data will first be read from the CMR zones (โผ8 sec, assuming a sequential throughput of 250MB/s), then the space will be changed to SMR format using the H-SMR API (50 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), resulting in 3GiB of SMR zones. Then the 2GiB of valid data will be written to the newly created SMR zones (โผ8 sec), leaving 1GiB of empty SMR space. Note that such conversion is time consuming and the valid data migration dominates the conversion overhead.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Elastic Space Mapping and Allocation</head><p>Overview and Zone Mapping <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The elastic data space is divided into zones (256MiB). Each zone in the elastic data space is mapped to an online CMR or SMR zone in the drive's logical disk space ( ยง2).</p><p>To reduce the SMR update overhead, in ZoneAlloy, we propose to use a small portion of the CMR space as a write buffer, namely H-Buffer (Host-controlled Buffer ยง3.3), with a size proportional to the SMR partition.</p><p>Two-phase Allocation. Disk space is allocated in two phases. In the first phase ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 left)</ref>, the disk is initially all in CMR format <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. ZoneAlloy allocates new space for the application from outer tracks to inner tracks, because the outer tracks are more performant due to the zone-bit encoding and the short-stroking effect.</p><p>In the second phase ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 right)</ref>, the disk format needs to be gradually converted from CMR to SMR when the application needs more capacity ( ยง2). ZoneAlloy performs conversion from inner tracks to outer tracks; i.e., the innermost area is first to convert from CMR to SMR, similar to the pro- cedure proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The H-Buffer is located in the outer tracks for performance and will expand proportionally as the SMR partition grows. In each conversion, the zone mapping is updated accordingly and persisted to ensure a linear elastic data space with no LBA gaps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Quantized Migration</head><p>Conversion is time consuming and intrusive to the application I/Os. For example, to make free space for a requested size quickly, a simple blocking conversion stops all the application I/Os until the requested space has been created. Consequently, the application I/O will be delayed by seconds, or even minutes, depending on the size of the requested space ( ยง2). This is not tolerable for some latency-sensitive applications.</p><p>There is an intrinsic trade-off between the performance of the application I/O and the conversion efficiency. Theoretically, the valid data migration job can be broken down into small piecemeal migrations and opportunistically inserted into the time intervals between adjacent application I/Os. In this case, the application I/O will experience little performance degradation. However, it will take a longer time for the conversion to finish, especially when the workload is intense without much time between adjacent I/Os.</p><p>Based on this observation, we propose a quantized migration mechanism in ZoneAlloy that helps the application find a favorable spot in the trade-off space. We define the migration quantum as the smallest-size unit of data to migrate that will carry to completion even after the application I/O arrives <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3)</ref>. A small migration quantum has less impact on the application, since the migration can be interrupted at a finer granularity causing less increase of latency to the application I/O. In contrast, a large migration quantum gives priority to the migration I/O, so the conversion will finish sooner, but the application I/O will have a greater latency increase.</p><p>The key insight here is that the maximum latency increase is proportional to the size of a migration quantum; therefore, adjusting the size of the migration quantum provides a mechanism that helps the application create free space as quickly as possible while providing a controllable performance degradation. The application can specify the value of the acceptable increase of latency. Then ZoneAlloy will determine a proper In-place FIFO log allocates redirected SMR blocks to the head and cleans from the tail by evicting every block belonging to the same zone as the tail block; Loop-back log distinguishes hot and cold SMR zones and only evicts data of cold zones out of H-Buffer while keeping hot data in H-Buffer by "requeuing" it to the head of the log (loop back). migration quantum size based on the disk parameters to ensure the increase of latency is bounded by that value. To ensure reliability during the migration, a persistent spare copy of the first two CMR zones of a migration quantum is created (e.g. in reserved SMR zones or non-volatile memory), then the two CMR zones are converted into three SMR zones that can store data copied from the two CMR zones to be converted next, so on and so forth. The data of the first two zones will be copied to the SMR zones at last.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">H-Buffer Management Policies</head><p>Updating an SMR zone directly using read-modify-write introduces significant performance overhead. Therefore, we propose to redirect the data into a small CMR buffer space (Host-controlled Buffer, or H-Buffer) to accumulate multiple updates and then migrate the data back to the SMR zone in a batch to amortize the read-modify-write overhead. Note that if an SMR write targets the write pointer, it will be directly issued to the SMR zone without entering the H-Buffer.</p><p>Improved block-based LRU. A first intuition is to leverage existing caching policies designed for main memory (e.g., LRU) to "cache" frequently updated data in the H-Buffer. As a result, subsequent updates to those data will happen in the CMR zones without introducing further SMR update overhead. However, directly adopting those caching policies results in poor performance because cache eviction happens frequently at the block granularity and each eviction reclaims one block of free space but triggers one expensive zone readmodify-write. Therefore, we design an improved block-based LRU policy that evicts the whole zone containing the victim block out of the H-Buffer instead of only evicting the victim block. Here evicting a zone means evicting every block from the H-Buffer that belongs to that zone. In this case, we pay the same price to read-modify-write one zone but reclaim more space, thus the eviction happens less frequently. However, this improved block LRU policy will fragment the free space of the H-Buffer, causing random I/Os which are not friendly to disk drives.</p><p>In-place FIFO Log. To avoid fragmenting the free space, we design an in-place FIFO log policy (upper figure in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>) that organizes the redirected data in a log structure. Redirected data, if already buffered in the log, will be in-place updated. Otherwise, it will be allocated to the log head pointer. Free space is reclaimed from the log tail pointer by log cleaning, which evicts the zone containing the tail block (the block at the tail pointer) and advances the tail pointer. Note that if the tail block has already been evicted, the tail pointer will be advanced without any eviction. However, the drawback of an in-place FIFO log is that it strictly follows the FIFO ordering and does not distinguish different types of zones. We observe that frequently updated data blocks will come back to the HBuffer soon after they were evicted and take up the space that was just been freed. In this case, the time consumed to readmodify-write the original SMR zone is wasted. Therefore, it is beneficial to distinguish different zones when making eviction decisions.</p><p>Loop-back Log. To improve from the in-place FIFO policy, we propose a loop-back log policy for the H-Buffer that identifies hot zones and "re-queues" the data of hot zones from the log tail to the log head without evicting them (called "loop back," see bottom figure in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>). Here we first define an epoch as the time for the log head pointer to go through a full cycle and come back to the beginning of the H-Buffer. Then a hot zone is defined as a zone that has all its buffered blocks in the current epoch written again in the next epoch. In this case, evicting this hot zone pays the price of one readmodify-write but gains little space back, so it is better to keep it in the H-Buffer instead of evicting it. Although alternatives exist, we find that block LRU is simple yet effective in predicting hot zones where zones that have the blocks only appearing in the MRU half are considered hot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Zone-Swap Scheme</head><p>Ideally, "hot" data is favorably allocated to CMR zones, so the H-Buffer cleaning cost will be less and the overall performance is better. However, this is not always the case. For example, after conversion, empty SMR space is created to store new data. However, new data may turn out to be "hot" and causes significant SMR update overhead. Similarly, data stored in the CMR space near the CMR/SMR boundary will be migrated to the SMR space during conversion, and it may also be "hot." Further, the I/O pattern keeps evolving, and existing data in the SMR space may become "hot" too.</p><p>To address this, we propose the Zone-Swap mechanism in ZoneAlloy that can dynamically exchange data between SMR and CMR zones to concentrate "hot" data in CMR zones. Although the idea of Zone-Swap is simple, finding good zone candidates to swap is not a trivial job, because swapping is an expensive operation that involves extra effort to read and write the zones. If it is not designed carefully, the overhead of swapping can possibly negate its benefit and bring the overall performance down.</p><p>We found that the hot/cold zone classification of the swapping decision is different from that in the H-Buffer eviction design. The space occupancy of a zone in the H-Buffer matters more in reducing the H-Buffer cleaning overhead than the block access recency as used in the H-Buffer. This is because a zone taking up more H-Buffer space, no matter if it is evicted or looped back in the H-Buffer, reduces the "equivalent" H-Buffer size, and therefore the H-Buffer fills up sooner and log cleaning occurs more frequently.</p><p>Therefore, Zone-Swap evaluates all zones in the H-Buffer at the beginning of each epoch and labels the zones with an occupancy above a threshold as "SMR swap candidates." Such SMR zones will be evicted when encountered by the log tail pointer in log cleaning. CMR zones that were not updated during last epoch become "CMR swap candidates." When an SMR swap candidate zone is evicted, it will be paired up with a CMR swap candidate if available. Then the data in the CMR and SMR candidate zones will be read and written back to each other's location after combining the updated data evicted from the H-Buffer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiment Setup</head><p>As there are no H-SMR products available, we built an H-SMR simulator with equations extracted from DiskSim <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Microsoft Research (MSR) Cambridge traces <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> are used for evaluation. The disk's full capacity is set to 1TB to match the LBA ranges of the traces. The SMR to CMR areal density ratio is set to 1.5:1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Overall Performance</head><p>In this section, we evaluate the overall performance of ZoneAlloy (H-Buffer using loop-back log policy with ZoneSwap enabled, denoted by zone-alloy) against three HBuffer baselines without Zone-Swap: H-Buffer using improved block-based LRU policy (improved-lru), H-Buffer using in-place FIFO policy (fifo), and H-Buffer using loopback log policy (loop-back). Only the traces with a write footprint greater than 10GB are used, because ones with a smaller write footprint do not fill up the H-Buffer and will not show any difference in performance. To stress test the system, the H-Buffer to SMR partition size ratio is set to as low as 0.02%, and the disk usage is set to 99.9% so that the majority of the disk is in SMR format. Average latency is measured and plotted in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>.</p><p>As seen in the figure, in-place FIFO reduces the average latency from the improved block-based LRU by 1.4ร hm_0 prn_0 prn_1 proj_0 proj_1 proj_2 prxy_0 prxy_1 rsrch_0 src1_0 src1_1 src1_2 src2_2 stg_0 ts_0 usr_0 usr_1 usr_2 web_0 Average Latency (ms) <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Overall performance of ZoneAlloy compared with three H-Buffer-only baselines. Note that the break of axis in the middle.  (rsrch_0, write footprint 10GB) to 45ร (proj_0 write footprint 144GB). The difference in performance improvement is due to the different write footprint: the larger the write footprint, the more data is redirected to H-Buffer, and the greater the performance gap will be. Comparing loop-back log and the in-place FIFO log, loop-back log performs similarly or better in all the 19 traces (max improvement at prn_1, a 4.4% reduction of average latency with 7% decrease in the zone read-modify-writes). Zone-Swap further improves from the loop-back log by up to 29% at proj_0, where the count of zone read-modify-writes is reduced from 2989 to 507 at a cost of only 55 zone-swaps. We notice only one case where Zone-Swap makes the performance worse (trace proj_1). This is because 89% of the operations in this trace are read, and swapping causes the logical adjacent data to be far apart, introducing large seek latency. Swapping algorithms considering the seek distance are left as future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Conversion Scheme Evaluation</head><p>In this section we evaluate the effectiveness of the quantized migration using a real-world workload (proj_1). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 7</ref>, the latency of every request (left y-axis) is depicted as a black dot. The top figure shows the normal I/O performance without a space extension request (hence no conversion happening), and the middle and bottom figures show the cases where the application is requesting 25GiB of new space (200 zones to convert) with acceptable increase of latency set to 60 ms and 100 ms, respectively. We also plot the number of remaining zones to convert (red line, right y-axis) to indicate the start and the end of the conversion.</p><p>The results show that ZoneAlloy is able to perform the conversion efficiently while controlling the increase of latency within the given bound. With a lower acceptable increase of latency (60 ms, middle <ref type="figure">figure)</ref>, ZoneAlloy finishes the conversion in a longer time (601 seconds). In contrast, the conversion time reduces to 432 seconds when the the acceptable increase of latency rises to 100 ms. This is quite efficient given the fact that the blocking conversion also takes โผ400 seconds to convert the same number of zones but blocks the application I/O for over 6 minutes.</p></div>

Other abstractions/models also exist, for example, there could be a physical space manager to carve out one piece of physical SMR space and let the application decide how to use that physical space. Although we do not assume any knowledge about the application in this paper, involving application awareness is another promising direction. For example, when giving out space to an archival application, we may directly provide SMR space instead of starting from all CMR space. For other applications, maybe a mix of CMR and SMR is more desirable, with a user-defined or system-inferred space ratio between them. What are the other possibilities?</p><p>Another important question to ask is which layer in the I/O stack we should use to solve those H-SMR data management issues. There are many alternatives, e.g., disk firmware, block layer, RAID, LVM, file systems, or databases (relational databases, key-value stores, etc.). Managing such drives in a lower layer can hide the hybrid SMR details without requiring the higher layers to be changed. In contrast, making the higher layers hybrid SMR-aware can make better decisions about the management as the higher layer has more information about the workload. However, managing the Hybrid SMR at a higher level limits the impact to a specific application and may not benefit other higher-layer applications.</p><p>There are also some open design issues for Hybrid SMR. We have covered some of the possibilities in this paper. However, there is still vast open space for research and investigation. One example is the Format Layout problem. What are the alternatives to arrange CMR/SMR partitions? Could an interleaved layout be any better? What are the trade-offs? What are the proper criteria to determine the location and size of the H-Buffer?</p><p>Additional challenges may include scalability and heterogeneity. In a large-scale storage system, what are the issues if using tens of thousands of hybrid SMR drives? Do we format them at once or gradually? How do we handle the data migration? In a mixed cluster with high-end and low-end SSDs, non-volatile memory, etc., how do we fit the hybrid SMR drive in to make a good trade-off among price, capacity, and performance?</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Hybrid SMR Drive</figDesc></figure>
