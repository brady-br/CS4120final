				<p>We present a virtual machine prototype, called Hy-draVM, that automatically extracts parallelism from legacy sequential code (at the bytecode level) through a set of techniques including code profiling, data dependency analysis, and execution analysis. HydraVM is built by extending the Jikes RVM and modifying its base-line compiler, and exploits software transactional memory to manage concurrent and out-of-order memory accesses. Our experimental studies show up to 5× speedup on the JOlden benchmark.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Many organizations with enterprise-class legacy software are increasingly faced with a hardware technology refresh challenge due to the ubiquity of chip multiprocessor (CMP) hardware. This problem is significant when legacy codebases run into several million LOC and are not significantly concurrent (often intentionally designed to be sequential to reduce development costs, while exploiting Moore's law of single-core chips). Manual exposition of concurrency is largely non-scalable for such codebases. In some instances, sources are not available due to proprietary reasons, intellectual property issues (of integrated third-party software), and organizational boundaries. This motivates techniques and tools for automated concurrency refactoring.</p><p>Past efforts on parallelizing sequential programs can be broadly classified into speculative and nonspeculative techniques. Non-speculative techniques, which are usually compiler-based, exploit loop-level parallelism, and differ on the type of data dependency that they handle (e.g., static arrays, dynamically allocated arrays, pointers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>Speculative techniques can be broadly classified based on 1) what program constructs they use to extract threads (e.g., loops, subroutines), 2) whether they are implemented in hardware or software, 3) whether they require source codes, and 4) whether they are done online, offline, or both. Of course, this classification is not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Parallelization using thread-level speculation (TLS) hardware has been extensively studied, most of which largely focus on loops <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Automatic and semi-automatic parallelization without TLS hardware have also been explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</p><p>Transactional memory (TM) has recently emerged as a powerful concurrency control abstraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. With TM, code that read/write shared memory objects is organized as transactions, which speculatively execute, while logging changes made to objects-e.g., using an undo-log or a write-buffer. When two transactions conflict (e.g., read/write, write/write), one of them is aborted and the other is committed, yielding (the illusion of) atomicity. Aborted transactions are re-started, after rolling-back the changes-e.g., undoing object changes using the undolog (eager), or discarding the write buffers (lazy). Besides a simple programming model, TM provides performance comparable to lock-based synchronization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, especially for high contention and read-dominated workloads, and is composable. Multiprocessor TM has been proposed in hardware (HTM), in software (STM), and in hardware/software combination.</p><p>Motivated by TM's advantages, several recent efforts have exploited TM for automatic parallelization. In particular, trace-based automatic/semi-automatic parallelization is explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, which use HTM to handle dependencies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> parallelizes loops with dependencies using thread pipelines, wherein multiple parallel thread pipelines run concurrently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> parallelizes loops by running them as transactions, with STM preserving the program order. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> parallelizes loops by running a non-speculative "lead" thread, while other threads run other iterations speculatively, with STM managing dependencies.</p><p>In this paper, we exploit STM for automated concurrency refactoring. Our basic idea is to optimistically split code (at the bytecode level) into parallel semiindependent sections, called superblocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. For each superblock, we create a synthetic method that contains the code for the superblock and receives variables accessed by the superblock as parameters, and returns the exit point of the superblock. This synthetic method is executed in a separate thread, and runs as a memory transaction, while relying on STM to detect and resolve memory conflicts (between the superblocks).</p><p>Thus, each transaction has its own memory that it accesses or modifies. When the transaction is invoked, a copy of all variables is made and is sent to the method. Upon successful completion of the transaction, this copy is then merged back with the master memory version. In short, our memory model is lazy-commit with writebuffer implementation. To distinguish between multiple copies of an object, an identifier is added to the header of an object, which is unique in all copies of the object. We define a successful execution of an invoked superblock as when 1) it does not cause a memory conflict with another superblock with an older chronological order, and 2) it is reachable in a future execution of the program.</p><p>We build these techniques into a virtual machine (VM) called, HydraVM, by extending the Jikes RVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and modifying its baseline compiler.</p><p>To handle potential memory conflicts, we develop ByteSTM, which is a VM-level STM implementation, which yields the following benefits: 1) Significant implementation flexibility in handling memory access at lowlevel (e.g., registers, thread stack) and for transparently manipulating bytecode instructions for transactional synchronization and recovery; 2) Higher performance due to implementing all TM building blocks (e.g., versioning, conflict detection, contention management) at bytecodelevel; and 3) Easy integration with other modules of HydraVM (Section 3.4). To preserve the program order, each transaction must wait until its preceding code in the original program has been executed to commit. Toward this, ByteSTM suspends completed transactions till their valid commit times are reached. Aborted transactions discard their changes and are either terminated (i.e., a program flow violation or a misprediction) or reexecuted (i.e., to resolve a data-dependency conflict).</p><p>We experimentally evaluated HydraVM on a set of benchmark applications, including a subset of the JOlden benchmark suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Our results reveal speedup of up to 5×.</p><p>Our work is different from past STM-based parallelization works in that we consider entire programs (not just loops such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>), and automatically identify parallel sections (i.e., superblocks) by compile and runtime program analysis techniques, which are then exe- Additionally, our work targets arbitrary programs (not just recursive such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), is entirely software-based (unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), and do not require program source code. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe HydraVM's design and underlying mechanisms. Section3 discusses HydraVM's implementation, and we report on our experimental studies in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5.</p><p>HydraVM is publicly available at www.hydravm.org.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Overview</head><p>Adaptive Optimization System (AOS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is a general VM architecture that allows online feedback-directed optimizations. In HydraVM, we extend the AOS architecture to enable parallelization of input programs, and dynamically refine parallelized sections based on execution. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows HydraVM's architecture, which contains six components:</p><p>• Profiler: performs static analysis and adds additional instructions to monitor data access and execution flow.</p><p>• Inspector: monitors program execution at run-time and produces profiling data.</p><p>• Recompilation: recompiles bytecode into machine code and reloads classes definitions at run-time.</p><p>• Knowledge Repository: a store for profiling data.</p><p>• Builder: uses profiling data to reconstruct the program as multi-threaded code, and tunes execution according to data access conflicts.</p><p>• TM Manager: does transactional concurrency control to guarantee safe memory and preserves execution order. HydraVM works in three phases. The first phase focuses on detecting parallel patterns in the code, by in- The second phase starts after collecting enough information in the Knowledge Repository about which blocks were executed and how they access memory. The Builder component uses this information to split the code into superblocks, which can be executed in parallel. New version of the code is generated and is compiled by the Recompilation component. The TM Manager manages memory access of the execution of the parallel version, and organizes transaction commit according to the original execution order. The manager collects profiling data including commit rate and conflicting threads.</p><p>The last phase is tuning the reconstructed program based on thread behavior (e.g., conflict rate). The Builder evaluates the previous reconstruction of superblocks by splitting or merging some of them, and reassigning them to threads. The last two phases continue back and forth till the end of program execution, as the second phase represents a feedback to the third one. The instrumentation code added in the first phase is used only during that phase to determine the dynamic behavior of the program, while the later two phases infer execution behavior through transaction conflict rates and commit rates.</p><p>HydraVM supports two modes: online and offline. In the online mode, we assume that program execution is long enough to capture parallel execution patterns. Otherwise, the first phase can be done in a separate preexecution phase, which can be classified as offline mode.</p><p>We now describe each of HydraVM's components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Bytecode Profiling</head><p>First, HydraVM accepts program bytecode and converts it to architecture-specific machine code. We consider the program as a set of basic blocks, where each basic block is a sequence of non-branching instructions 1 f o r ( I n t e g e r i = 0 ; i &lt; DIMx ; i ++) 2 f o r ( I n t e g e r j = 0 ; j &lt; DIMx ; j ++) 3 f o r ( I n t e g e r k = 0 ; k &lt; DIMy ; k ++) 4</p><p>X</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[ i ] [ j ] += A[ i ] [ k ] * B [ k ] [ j ] ;</formula><p>Figure 3: Matrix Multiplication Example that ends either with a branch instruction (conditional or non-conditional) or a return. Thus, any program can be represented by a graph in which nodes represent basic blocks and edges represent the program control flowi.e., an execution graph (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Basic blocks can be determined at compile-time. However, our main goal is to determine the context and frequency of reachability of the basic blocks -i.e., when the code is revisited through execution. To collect this information, we modify Jikes RVM's baseline compiler to insert additional instructions (in the program bytecode) at the edges of the basic blocks (e.g., branching, conditional, return statements) that detect whenever a basic block is reached. Additionally, we insert instructions into the bytecode to 1) statically detect the set of variables accessed by the basic blocks, and 2) mark basic blocks with input/output operations, as they need special handling in program reconstruction. This code modification doesn't affect the behavior of the original program. We call this version of the modified program, profiled bytecode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Superblock detection</head><p>With the profiled bytecode, we can view the program execution as a graph with basic blocks and variables represented as nodes, and the execution flow as edges. A basic block that is visited more than once during execution will be represented by a different node each time. The benefits of execution graph are multifold: 1) Hot-spot portions of the code can be identified by examining the graph's hot paths, 2) static data dependencies between blocks can be determined, and 3) parallel execution patterns of the program can be identified.</p><p>To determine superblocks, we use a string factorization technique: each basic block is represented by a character that acts like an unique ID for that block. Now, an execution of a program can be represented as a string. For example, <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows a matrix multiplication code snippet. An execution of this code for a 2x2 matrix can be represented as the string ab jbhc f e f ghc f e f ghi jbhc f e f ghc f e f ghi jk. We factorize this string into its basic components using a variant of Main's algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that we have developed (our variant is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>). The factorization converts the matrix multiplication string into ab( jb(hc f e f g) 2 hi) 2 jk. Using this representation, com- bined with grouping blocks that access the same memory locations, we divide the code into a set of nested calls, where each call execute a group of basic blocks, which becomes a superblock.</p><p>Thus, we divide the code, optimistically, into independent parts called superblocks that represent subsets of the execution graph. Each superblock represents a long sequence of instructions, and accesses a known set of variables.</p><p>I/O instructions are excluded from superblocks, as changing their execution order affects the program semantics, and they are irrevocable (i.e., at transaction aborts).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Code Reconstruction</head><p>Upon detection of candidate superblocks for parallelization, the program is reconstructed as a producerconsumer pattern. In this pattern, two daemons threads are active, producer and consumer, which share a common fixed-size queue of tasks. The producer generates jobs and adds them in the queue, while the consumer dequeues the jobs and executes them. HydraVM uses a Collector module and an Executor module to process the superblocks: the Collector has access to the generated superblocks and uses them as jobs, while the Executor executes the superblocks by assigning them to a pool of core threads. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> shows the overall pattern of the generated program. Under this pattern, we utilize the available cores by executing the superblocks in parallel. However, doing so requires handling of several issues such as:</p><p>• Threads may finish in out of original execution order.</p><p>• The execution flow can be determined only at runtime. This may cause some of the assigned superblocks to be skipped from the correct execution.</p><p>• Due to the differences between execution flow in the profiling phase and the actual execution, memory access conflicts between concurrent accesses may occur. Also, memory arithmetic (e.g., arrays indexed with variables) may easily violate the program reconstruction (see example in Section 3.2). To tackle these problems, we execute each thread as a transaction. A transaction's changes are deferred until commit. At commit time, a transaction commits its changes if and only if: 1) it did not conflict with any other concurrent transaction, and 2) it is reachable under the execution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">TM Managed Parallelization</head><p>To ensure data consistency, we use STM. Memory access violations are detected and resolved by STM through transactional conflict detection, abort, roll-back, and retry. Program order is maintained by deferring the commit of transactions that complete early till their valid execution order.</p><p>Consider the example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, where three superblocks A, B, and C are assigned to different threads T A , T B , and T C and execute as three transactions t A , t B , and t C , respectively. Superblock A can have B or C as its successor, and that cannot be determined until runtime. According to the parallel execution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>(b), T C will finish execution before others. However, t C will not commit until t A or t B completes successfully. This requires that every transaction must notify the STM to permit its successor to commit. Now, let t A conflict with t B because of unexpected memory access. STM will favor the older transaction in the original execution and abort t B , and will discard its local changes. Later, t B will be re-executed. A problem arises if t A and t C wrongly and unexpectedly access the same memory location. Under <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>(b)'s parallel execution scenario, this will not be detected as a transactional conflict (T C finishes before T A ). To handle this scenario, we extend the life time of transactions to the earliest transaction starting time. When a transaction must wait for its predecessor to commit, its life time is extended till the end of its predecessor. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5(c)</ref> shows the execution from the TM perspective.</p><p>2.5 Reconstruction Tuning TM preserves data consistency, but it may cause degraded performance due to successive conflicts. To reduce this, the TM Manager provides feedback to the Builder component to reduce the number of conflicts. We store the commit rate, and the conflicting scenarios in the Knowledge Repository to be used later for y = 1 y1 = 1 y += 2 y2 = y1 + 2 x = y x1 = y2</p><p>Figure 6: Static Single Assignment form Example further reconstruction. When the commit rate reaches a minimum preconfigured rate, the Builder is invoked. Conflicting superblocks are combined into a single superblock. This requires changes to the control instructions (e.g., branching conditions) to maintain the original execution flow. The newly reconstructed version is recompiled and loaded as a new class definition at runtime.</p><p>3 Implementation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Detecting Real Memory Dependencies</head><p>Recall that we use bytecode as the input, and concurrency refactoring is done entirely at the VM level.</p><p>Compiler optimizations such as register reductions and variable substitutions increase the difficulty in detecting memory dependencies at the bytecode-level. For example, two independent basic blocks in the source code may share the same set of local variables or loop counters in the bytecode. To overcome this problem, we transform the bytecode into the Static Single Assignment form (SSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The SSA form guarantees that each local variable has a single static point of definition, which significantly simplifies analysis. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows an example of the SSA form.</p><p>Using the SSA form, we inspect assignment statements, which reflect memory operations required by the basic block. At the end of each basic block, we generate a call for a touch operation that notifies the VM about the variables that were accessed in that basic block. In the second phase of profiling, we record the execution paths and the memory accessed during those paths. We then package each set of basic blocks in a superblock. Superblocks should not be conflicting and access the same memory objects. However, it is possible to have such conflicts, since our analysis uses information from past execution. We intentionally designed the data dependency algorithm to ignore some questionable data dependencies (e.g., loop index). This gives more opportunities for parallelization, since if at run time, a questionable dependency occurs, the STM will detect and handle it. Thus, more blocks can run in parallel and greater speedup can be achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Misprofiling</head><p>We rely on our analysis on online profiling for detecting execution flow, which mainly depends on the input in the profiling phase. This input may not reflect some run-time aspects of the program flow (e.g., loops limits, biased branches). To illustrate this, we return to the matrix multiplication example in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Based on the profiling using 2x2 matrices, we construct the execution graph shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Now, assume that we have the following superblocks ab, jbhi, hc f e f g, and jk, and we need to run this code for matrices 2x3 and 3x2. The Collector will assign jobs to the Executor, but upon the execution of the superblock jk, the Executor will find that the code exits after j and needs to execute bhi. Hence, it will request the Collector to schedule the job jbhi in the incoming job set. Doing so allows us to extend the flow to cover more iterations. Note that the entry point must be send to the synthetic method that represents the superblock, as it should be able to start from any of its basic blocks (e.g., jbhi will start from b not j, as j already executed before).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Method Inlining</head><p>Method inlining is the insertion of the complete body of a method at every place that it is called. In HydraVM, method calls appear as basic blocks, and in the execution graph, they appear as nodes. Thus, inlining occurs automatically as a side effect of the reconstruction process. This eliminates the time overhead of invoking a method.</p><p>Another interesting issue is handling recursive calls. The execution graph for recursion will appear as a repeated sequence of basic blocks (e.g., abababab . . . ). Similar to method-inlining, we merge multiple levels of recursion into a single superblock, which reduces the overhead of managing parameters over the heap. Thus, a recursive call under HydraVM will be formed as nested transactions with lower depth than the original recursive code.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">ByteSTM</head><p>ByteSTM is an STM implementation that operates at the bytecode level and is integrated into HydraVM. We implemented ByteSTM by modifying the Jikes RVM by adding bytecode-level instructions to support transactions -e.g., xBegin and xCommit are used to start and end a transaction, respectively. Each memory load/store instruction inside a transaction is executed transactionally. ByteSTM's implementation is based on the RingSTM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. With RingSTM, transactional writes are buffered in a redo log. Each transaction has a read signature and a write signature (represented using bloom filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) that summarize all read locations and written locations, respectively. A transaction validates its read-set by intersecting its read signature with other concurrent committed transactions' write signatures in a ring. The ring is a circular buffer that stores all committed transactions' write signatures. At commit time, a validation is done again. If the transaction is valid, then the transaction's write signature is added to the ring using a single Compare-And-Swap operation. If it is successfully added to the ring, then the transaction is committed, and it writes back the redo log values to memory.</p><p>Each superblock has an order that represents its logical order in the sequential execution of the original program. To preserve the data consistency between superblocks, STM must be modified to support this ordering. Thus, in ByteSTM, when a conflict is detected between two superblocks, we abort the one with the higher order. Also, when a block with a higher order tries to commit, we force it to sleep until its order is reached. ByteSTM commits the block if no conflict is detected.</p><p>When attempting to commit, each transaction checks its order against the expected order. If they are the same, the transaction proceeds and updates the expected order. Otherwise, it sleeps and waits for its turn. After committing, each thread checks if the next thread is waiting for its turn to commit, and if so, that thread is woken up.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Parallelizing Nested Loops</head><p>Nested loops are generally difficult for parallelization, as it is difficult to parallelize both inner and outer loops. In HydraVM, we handle nested loops as nested transactions using the closed-nesting model <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>: aborting a parent transaction aborts all its inner transactions, but not vice versa, and changes made by inner transactions become visible to their parents when they commit, but those changes are hidden from outside world till the highest level parent's commit.</p><p>Consider our earlier matrix multiplication example. We have an outer transaction jbhi, which invokes a set of inner transactions hc f e f g after the execution of the basic block b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Evaluation</head><p>Benchmarks. To evaluate HydraVM, we used five applications as benchmarks. These include a matrix multiplication application and four applications from the JOlden benchmark suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>: minimum spanning tree (MST), tree add (TreeAdd), traveling salesman (TSP), and bitonic sort (BiSort). The applications are written as sequential applications, though they exhibit data-level parallelism.</p><p>Testbed. We conducted our experiments on an 8-core multicore machine, which has 2 Intel Xeon Processors (E5520), each with 4 cores running at 2.27GHz, with 256 KB L1 data cache, 1 MB L2 data cache, and 8 MB L3 data cache. The machine runs Ubuntu Linux Server 10.04 LTS 64-bit. JikesRVM version 3.1.0 is used to run all experiments. We configured it to run using the Jikes Baseline compiler and mark-and-sweep GC, which match ByteSTM configurations.</p><p>Evaluation.  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>: HydraVM Speedup shows the number of executed jobs by the Executor, and the maximum level of nesting during the experiments. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the speedup obtained over the original benchmark running on an unmodified Jikes RVM. We change the number of used cores by setting the process affinity. For matrix multiplication, HydraVM reconstructs the outer two loops into nested transactions, while the inner-most loop is formed into a superblock because of the iteration dependencies. In TSP, BiSort, and TreeAdd, each multiple level of recursive call is inlined into a single superblock. For the MST benchmark, each iteration over the graph adds a new node to the MST, which creates inter-dependencies between iterations. However, updating the costs from the constructed MST and other nodes presents a good parallelization opportunity for HydraVM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions</head><p>We presented HydraVM, a JVM that automatically refactors concurrency in Java programs at the bytecode-level. Our basic idea is to reconstruct the code in a way that exhibits data-level and execution-flow parallelism. STM was exploited as memory guards that preserve consistency and program order.
