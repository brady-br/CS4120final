				<p>Today&apos;s networks typically carry or deploy dozens of protocols and mechanisms simultaneously such as MPLS, NAT, ACLs and route redistribution. Even when individual protocols function correctly, failures can arise from the complex interactions of their aggregate, requiring network administrators to be masters of detail. Our goal is to automatically find an important class of failures , regardless of the protocols running, for both operational and experimental networks. To this end we developed a general and protocol-agnostic framework, called Header Space Analysis (HSA). Our formalism allows us to statically check network specifications and configurations to identify an important class of failures such as Reachability Failures, Forwarding Loops and Traffic Isolation and Leakage problems. In HSA, protocol header fields are not first class entities; instead we look at the entire packet header as a concatenation of bits without any associated meaning. Each packet is a point in the {0, 1} L space where L is the maximum length of a packet header, and networking boxes transform packets from one point in the space to another point or set of points (multicast). We created a library of tools, called Hassel, to implement our framework, and used it to analyze a variety of networks and protocols. Hassel was used to analyze the Stanford University backbone network, and found all the forwarding loops in less than 10 minutes, and verified reachability constraints between two subnets in 13 seconds. It also found a large and complex loop in an experimental loose source routing protocol in 4 minutes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>"Accidents will occur in the best-regulated families" -Charles Dickens</p><p>In the beginning, a switch or router was breathtakingly simple. About all the device needed to do was index into a forwarding table using a destination address, and decide where to send the packet next. Over time, forwarding grew more complicated. Middleboxes (e.g., NAT and firewalls) and encapsulation mechanisms (e.g., VLAN and MPLS) appeared to escape from IP's limitations: e.g., NAT bypasses address limits and MPLS allows flexible routing. Further, new protocols for specific domains, such as data centers, WANs and wireless, have greatly increased the complexity of packet forwarding. Today, there are over 6,000 Internet RFCs and it is not unusual for a switch or router to handle ten or more encapsulation formats simultaneously.</p><p>This complexity makes it daunting to operate a large network today. Network operators require great sophistication to master the complexity of many interacting protocols and middleboxes. The future is not any more rosy -complexity today makes operators wary of trying new protocols, even if they are available, for fear of breaking their network. Complexity also makes networks fragile, and susceptible to problems where hosts become isolated and unable to communicate. Debugging reachability problems is very time consuming. Even simple questions are hard to answer, such as "Can Host A talk to Host B?" or "Can packets loop in my network?" or "Can User A listen to communications between Users B and C?". These questions are especially hard to answer in networks carrying multiple encapsulations and containing boxes that filter packets.</p><p>Thus, our first goal is to help system administrators statically analyze production networks today. We describe new methods and tools to provide formal answers to these questions, and many other failure conditions, regardless of the protocols running in the network.</p><p>Our second goal is to make it easier for system administrators to guarantee isolation between sets of hosts, users or traffic. Partitioning networks this way is usually called "slicing"; VLANs are a simple example used today. If configured correctly, we can be confident that traffic in one slice (e.g. a VLAN) cannot leak into another. This is useful for security, and to help answer questions such as "Can I prevent Host A from talking to Host B?". For example, imagine two health-care providers using the same physical network. HIPAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> rules require that no information about a patient can be read by other providers. Thus a natural application of slicing is to place each provider in a separate slice and guarantee that no packet from one slice can be controlled by or read by the other slice. We call this secure slicing. Secure slicing may also be useful for banks as part of defense-in-depth, and for classified and unclassified users sharing the same physical network. Our tools can verify that slices have been correctly configured.</p><p>Our third goal is to take the notion of isolation further, and enable the static analysis of networks sliced in more general ways. For example, with FlowVisor <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> a slice can be defined by any combination of header fields. A slice consists of a topology of switches and links, the set of headers on each link, and its share of link capacity. Each slice has its own control plane, allowing its owner to decide how packets are routed and processed. While tools such as FlowVisor allow rapid deployment of new protocols, they add to the complexity of the network, pushing the level of detail beyond the comprehension of a human operator. Our tools allow automatic analysis of the network configuration to formally prove that the slicing is operating as intended.</p><p>In the face of this need, it is surprising that there are very few existing network management tools to analyze large networks. Further, the tools that exist are protocol dependent and specialized to each task. For example, the pioneering work of Xie, et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> on static reachability analysis, the analyses of IP connectivity and firewall configuration, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and work on routing failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> are all tailored to IP networks. While these papers suggest powerful approaches for reachability in IP networks, they do not easily extend to new protocols and new types of checks.</p><p>This paper introduces a general framework, called Header Space Analysis, which provides a set of tools and insights to model and check networks for a variety of failure conditions in a protocol-independent way. Key to our approach is a generalization of the geometric approach to packet classification pioneered by Lakshman and Stiliadis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, in which classification rules over K packet fields are viewed as subspaces in a K dimensional space.</p><p>We generalize in three ways. First, we jettison the notion of pre-specified fields in favor of a header space of L bits where each packet is represented by a point in {0, 1} L space, where L is the header length. This allows us to work with emerging protocols and arbitrary field formats. Second, we go beyond modeling packet classification in which a header is mapped to a single point in a matching subspace. Instead, we model all router and middlebox processing as box transfer functions transforming subspaces of the L-dimensional space to other subspaces. For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, A and B are arbitrary boxes, and T A and T B represent their transfer functions. We model how a packet or flow is modified as it travels by composing the transfer functions along the path. Third, we go beyond modeling a single box to modeling a network of boxes using a network transfer function, Ψ and a topology transfer function, Γ. Ψ combines all individual box functions into one giant function. Γ models the links that connect ports together. The over- all behavior of the network is modeled as a black box by composing Ψ and Γ along all paths. The contributions of this paper and an outline of the rest of the paper are as follows:</p><p>• Header Space Analysis: Section 2 describes the geometric model and defines transfer functions. Section 3 shows how transfer functions can be used to model today's networking boxes. Section 4 describes an algebra for working on header space.</p><p>• Use Cases: Section 5 describes how header space analysis can be used to detect network failures such as reachability failures, routing loops and slice isolation in a protocol independent way.</p><p>• Implementation: Section 6 describes a library of tools (called Hassel, or Header Space Library), based on header space analysis, that can statically analyze networks. We describe five key optimizations that boost Hassel's performance by 5 orders of magnitude relative to a naive implementation.</p><p>• Experiments: Section 7 reports results of using Hassel to analyze three examples: (1) Stanford University's backbone network, (2) Slice isolation check, and (3) An experimental source routing protocol. We report loops found, and show that even our Python implementation scales to large enterprise networks with our optimizations.</p><p>We describe limitations of our approach and related work in Sections 8 and 9. We conclude in Section 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Geometric Model</head><p>Our header space framework is built on a geometric model. We model packets as points in a geometric space and network boxes as transfer functions on the same geometric space. Our first task is to define the main geo-metric spaces.</p><p>Header Space, H: We ignore the protocol-specific meanings associated with header bits and view a packet header as a flat sequence of ones and zeros. Formally, a header is a point and a flow is a region in the {0, 1} L space, where L is an upper bound on the header length. We call this space Header Space, H.</p><p>A wildcard expression is the basic building block used to define objects in H. Each wildcard expression is a sequence of L bits where each bit can be either 0, 1 or x. Each wildcard expression corresponds to a hypercube in H. Every region, or flow, in H is defined as a union of wildcard expressions.</p><p>H abstracts away the data portion of a packet because we assume it does not affect packet processing. If it does, as in an intrusion-detection box, then L must be the length of the entire packet. If the fields are fixed, we can define macros for each field in H to reduce dimensionality. However, the general notion of header space is critical when dealing with different protocols that interpret the same header bits in different ways. Note also that we can model variable length fields such as IP options using a custom parsing function as shown in Section 7.3.</p><p>Network Space, N : We model the network as a set of boxes called switches with external interfaces called ports each of which is modeled as having a unique identifier. We use "switches" to denote routers, bridges, and any possible middlebox.</p><p>If we take the cross-product of the switch-port space (the space of all ports in the network, S) with H, we can represent a packet traversing on a link as a point in {0, 1} L × {1, ..., P } space, where {1, ..., P } is the list of ports in the network. We call the space of all possible packet headers, localized at all possible input ports in the network, the Network Space, N .</p><p>Network Transfer Function, Ψ(): As a packet traverses the network, it is transformed from one point in Network Space to other point(s) in Network Space. For example, a layer 2 switch, that merely forwards a packet from one port to another, without rewriting headers, transforms packets only along the switch-port axis, S. On the other hand, an IPv4 router that rewrites some fields (e.g. MAC address, TTL, checksum) and then forwards the packet, transforms the packet both in H and S.</p><p>As these examples suggest, all networking boxes can be modeled as Transformers with a Transfer Function (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>), that models their protocol dependent functions. More precisely, a node can be modeled using its transfer function, T , that maps header h arriving on port p:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T (h, p) : (h, p) → {(h 1 , p 1 ), (h 2 , p 2 ), ...}</formula><p>In general, the transfer function may depend on the input port to model input-port-specific behavior and the output may be a set of (header, port) pairs to allow multicasting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> A concept we use heavily is the network transfer function, Ψ(.). Given that switch ports are numbered uniquely, we combine all the box transfer functions into a composite transfer function describing the overall behavior of the network. Formally, if a network consists of n boxes with transfer functions T 1 (.), ..., T n (.), then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ψ(h, p) =      T 1 (h, p) if p ∈ switch 1 ... ... T n (h, p) if p ∈ switch n</formula><p>Topology Transfer Function, Γ(): We can model the network topology using a topology transfer function, Γ(), defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Γ(h, p) = {(h, p * )} if p connected to p * {} if p is not connected.</formula><p>Γ models the behavior of links in the network. It accepts a packet at one end of a link and returns the same packet, unchanged, at the other end. Note that links are unidirectional in this model. To model bidirectional links, one rule should be added per direction. Multihop Packet Traversal: Using the two transfer functions, we can model a packet as it traverses the network by applying Φ(.) = Ψ(Γ(.)) at each hop. For example, if a packet with header h enters a network on port p, the header after k hops will be Ψ(Γ(...(Ψ <ref type="figure">(Γ(h, p)</ref>...), or simply Φ k (h, p): each Γ forwards the packet on a link and each Ψ passes the packet through a box.</p><p>Slice: A slice, S, can be defined as (Slice network space, Permission, Slice Transfer Function) where Slice network space is a subset of the network space controlled by the slice, and Permission is a subset of {read(r), write(w)} 2 . The Slice Transfer Function, Ψ s (h, p), captures the behavior of all rules installed by the control plane of slice S. For example, a slice that controls packets destined to subnet 192.168.1.0/24 and is restricted to network ports 1, 2 and 3 can be expressed as ((ip dst(h) = 192.168.1.x , p ∈ {1, 2, 3}), rw , Ψ s ). Here, ip dst(h) is a helper function refering to the IP destination bits in the header.</p><p>Our concept of a slice combines two notions we normally think of as very different. It describes the implicit slicing, when protocols coexist today on the same network using protocol IDs (e.g. TCP and UDP) or networks partitioned using Vlan IDs. It also describes the explicit slicing utilized by <ref type="bibr">FlowVisor [6]</ref> to create independent experiments in an OpenFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> network, as done in testbed networks such as GENI 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Modeling Networking Boxes</head><p>This section is a brief tutorial on transfer functions in order to illustrate their power in modeling different boxes in a unified way. We use helper functions for clarity. We refer to a particular field in a particular protocol using helper function protocol f ield(). For example, ip src(h) refers to the source IP address bits of header h. Similarly, helper function R(h, f ields, values) is used to rewrite the fields in h with values. For example, R(h, mac dst(), d) rewrites the MAC destination address to d. Header updates can be represented by a masking AND followed by a rewrite OR.</p><p>We start by modeling an IPv4 router which processes packets as follows: 1) Rewrite source and destination MAC addresses, 2) Decrement TTL, 3) Update checksum, 4) Forward to outgoing port. Thus the transfer function of an IPv4 router concatenates four functions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">T IP v4 (.) = T f wd (T chksum (T ttl (T mac (.)))).</formula><p>We examine each function in turn. T f wd (.) looks up ip dst(h) in a lookup table and returns the output port. If lookup is modeled as ip lookup(.) : ip dst → port:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">T f wd (h, p) = {(h, ip lookup(ip dst(h)))}</formula><p>Similarly, T mac (.) looks up the next hop MAC address and updates source and destination MAC addresses. T ttl (.) drops the packet if ip ttl(h) is 0 and otherwise does R(h, ip ttl(), ip ttl(h) − 1). T chksum (.) updates the IP checksum. If the focus is on IP routing, we might choose to ignore T mac (.), simplifying the model to T IP v4 (.) = T f wd (T ttl (.)) or even T IP v4 (.) = T f wd ().</p><p>As an example, a simplified transfer function of an IPv4 router that forwards subnet S 1 traffic to port p 1 , S 2 traffic to port p 2 and S 3 traffic to port p 3 is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">T r (h, p) =          {(h, p 1 )} if ip dst(h) ∈ S 1 {(h, p 2 )} if ip dst(h) ∈ S 2 {(h, p 3 )} if ip dst(h) ∈ S 3 {} otherwise.</formula><p>A firewall is modeled as a transfer function that extracts IP and TCP headers, matches the headers against a sequence of wildcard expressions (which model ACL rules), and drops or forwards the packet as specified by the matching rule. A tunneling end point is modeled using a shift operator that shifts the payload packet to the right and a rewrite operator that rewrites the beginning <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> In GENI parlance, the network space of a slice is called flow space.</p><p>of the header. A Network Address Translator (NAT) box can also be modeled using a rewrite operator. However the level of details that we use in our model depends on the application. For example we can have a detailed model where we model the exact source IP to source transport port mapping, or we may set the output transport source port to a wildcard (all x) to represent every possible mapping. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> we provide more examples. While modeling is trivial but tedious, we have written tools that parse router configuration files and forwarding tables to automate the process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Header Space Algebra</head><p>Algorithms that compute reachability or determine if two slices can interact must determine how different spaces overlap. We therefore need to define basic set operations on H: intersection, union, complementation and difference. We also define the Domain, Range and Range Inverse for transfer functions. The next section shows how this algebra is used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Set Operations on H</head><p>While set operations on bit vectors are well-known, we need set operations on wildcard expressions. Since all objects in header space can be represented as a union of wildcard expressions, defining set operation on wildcard expressions allows these operations to carry over to header space objects. For the rest of this paper, we overload the term header to refer to both packet headers (points in H) and wildcard expressions (hyper-cubes in H).</p><p>Intersection: For two headers to have a non-empty intersection, both headers must have the same bit value at every position that is not a wildcard. If two headers differ in bit b i , then the two headers will be in different hyper-planes defined by b i = 0 and b i = 1. On the other hand, if one header has an x in a position while the other header has a 1 or 0, the intersection is non-empty. Thus, the single-bit intersection rule for b i ∩ b i is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">H H H H H b i b i 0 1 x 0 0 z 0 1 z 1 1 x 0 1 x</formula><p>In the table, z means the bitwise intersection is empty. The intersection of two headers is found by applying the single-bit intersection rule, bit-by-bit, to the headers. z is an "annihilator": if any bit returns z, the intersection of all bits is empty. Encode each bit in the header using two bits: 0 → 01, 1 → 10, x → 11 and z → 00. Intersection, then, is simply an AN D operation on the encoded headers.</p><p>Union: In general, a union of wildcard expressions cannot be simplified. For example, no single header can represent the union of 1111xxxx and 0000xxxx. This is why a header space object is defined as a union of wildcard expressions. In some cases, we can simplify the union (e.g., 1100xxxx ∪ 1000xxxx simplifies to 1x00xxxx) by simplifying an equivalent boolean expression. For example, 10xx ∪ 011x is equivalent to</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">b 4 b 3 ⊕ b 4 b 3 b 2 .</formula><p>This allows the use of Karnaugh Maps and Quine-McCluskey <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> algorithms for logic minimization.</p><p>Complementation: The complement of header hthe union of all headers that do not intersect with h -is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">h ← φ for bit b i in h do if b i = x then h ← h ∪ x...xb i x...x end if end for return h</formula><p>The algorithm finds all non-intersecting headers by replacing each 0 or 1 in the header with its complement. This follows because just one non-intersecting bit (or z) in a term results in a disjoint header. For example,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(100xxxxx) = 0xxxxxxx ∪ x1xxxxxx ∪ xx1xxxxx.</formula><p>Difference: The difference (or minus) operation can be calculated using intersection and complementation. A − B = A ∩ B . For example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">100xxxxx − 10011xxx = 100xxxxx ∩ (0xxxxxxx ∪ x1xxxxxx ∪ xx1xxxxx ∪xxx0xxxx ∪ xxxx0xxx) = φ ∪ φ ∪ φ ∪ 1000xxxx ∪ 100x0xxx = 1000xxxx ∪ 100x0xxx.</formula><p>The difference operation can be used to check if one header is a subset of another: A ⊆ B ⇐⇒ A − B = φ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Domain, Range and Range Inverse</head><p>To capture the destiny of packets through a box or set of boxes, we define the domain, range and range inverse as follows:</p><p>Domain: The domain of a transfer function is the set of all possible (header, port) pairs that the transfer function accepts. Even headers for which the output is empty (i.e., dropped packets) belong to the domain.</p><p>Range: The range of a transfer function is the set of all possible (header, port) pairs that the transfer function can output after applying all possible inputs on every port.</p><p>Range Inverse: Reachability and loop detection computation requires working backwards from a range to determine what input (header, port) pairs could have produced it. If S = {(h 1 , p 1 ), ..., (h j , p 2 )}, then the range inverse of S under transfer function T (.) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">X = {(h i , p i )}] n 1 such that T (X) = S. Equivalently, X = T −1 (S).</formula><p>The inverse of a transfer function is welldefined: A transfer function maps each (h, p) pair to a set of other pairs. By following the mapping backward, we can invert a transfer function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Using Header Space Analysis</head><p>In this section we show how the header space analysis -developed in the last three sections -can be used for solving several classical networking problems in a protocol-agnostic way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Reachability Analysis</head><p>Xie, et. al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> analyze reachability by tracing which of all possible packet headers at a source can reach a destination. We follow a similar approach, but generalize to arbitrary protocols. Using header space analysis, we consider the space of all headers leaving the source, then track this space as it is transformed by each successive networking box along the path (or paths) to the destination. At the destination, if no header space remains, the two hosts cannot communicate. Otherwise, we trace the remained header spaces backwards (using the range inverse at each step) to find the set of headers the source can send to reach the destination.</p><p>Consider, for example, the question: Can packets from host a reach host b?. Define the reachability function R between a and b as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">R a→b = a→b paths {T n (Γ(T n−1 (......(Γ(T 1 (h, p)...))}</formula><p>where for each path between a and b, {T 1 , ..., T n−1 , T n } are the transfer functions along the path. The switches in each path are denoted by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">a → S 1 → ... → S n−1 → S n → b.</formula><p>The Range of R a→b is the set of headers that can reach b from a. Notice that these headers are seen at b, and not necessarily headers transmitted by a, since headers may change in transit. We can find which packet headers can leave a and reach b by computing the range inverse. If header h ⊂ H reached b along the a → S 1 → ... → S n−1 → S n → b path, then the original header sent by a is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">h a = T −1 1 (Γ(...(T −1 n−1 (Γ(T −1 n ((h, b))...)),</formula><p>using the fact that Γ = Γ −1 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">a A 0 A 1 B 0 B 1 1001xxxx 0011xxxx xxxxxxxx 1001xx10 0011xx10 C 0 D 0 10011x10 C 1 C 2 E 1 10010x10 01011x10 E 0 D 1 b 01011x10 10010x10 E 2 C 3 TD(h, p) = 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : if h=100xxxxx, p = D0 : {((h&amp;00011111)|01000000, D1)} if h=110xxxxx, p = D1 :</formula><p>{((h&amp;00011111)|01100000, D0)} <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Example for computing reachability function from a to b. For simplicity, we assume a header length of 8 and show the first 4 bits on the x-axis and the last 4 bits on the y-axis. We show the range (output) of each transfer function composition along the paths that connect a to b. At the end, the packet headers that b will see from a are 01011x10 ∪ 10010x10.</p><p>To provide intuition, we do reachability analysis for the small example network in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Each box in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 2</ref> contains its transfer function. To keep things simple, we only use 8-bit headers; since we cannot easily depict eight dimensions, we represent the first 4 bits of the header on the x-axis and the last 4 bits on the y-axis. Note that in this example, A and C are miniature models of IP routers, B is a firewall, D is a simplified NAT box and E behaves like an Ethernet switch. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows how the network boxes transform header space along each path. By repeatedly applying the output of each transfer function to the input of the next transfer function in each path, the reachability function from a to b becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">R a→b (h, p) =          if h=10010x10, p = A 0 : {(h, E 2 )} if h=10011x10, p = A 0 : {((h&amp;00011111)|01000000, E 2 )}</formula><p>The range of R a→b , which is the final output set in <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>, is 10010x10 ∪ 01011x10. This is the set of headers that can reach b from a. To find the set of headers that a can send to b, we compute the range inverse of R a→b which is 10010x10 ∪ 10011x10. Complexity: As we push the test packet toward the destination, the transfer function rules divide the input headerspace into smaller pieces. If the headerspace consists of the union of R 1 wildcard expressions and the transfer function has R 2 rules, then the output can be a headerspace with O(R 1 R 2 ) wildcard expressions. However, this is the worst case scenario. In a real network whose purpose is to provide connectivity, as the header space propagates to the core of the network, the match patterns of forwarding rules will become less specific, therefore the space will not be divided into too many pieces. Most of the flow division happens as a result of rules that are filtering out some part of input flow (e.g. ACL rules). As a result, each of the input wildcard expressions will match only a few rules in the transfer function and generate at most cR (and not R 2 ), where c &lt;&lt; R. We call this, the Linear Fragmentation assumption. Under this assumption, the running time is O(dR 2 ) where d is the network diameter -the maximum number of hubs that a packet will go through before reaching the destination -and R is the maximum number of forwarding rules in a router. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for more details. While our algorithm may appear almost to be a simulation, we gain algorithmic leverage by treating groups of headers as an equivalence class wherever possible. By contrast, a brute-force algorithm that simulates the sending of every possible packet has O(2 L ) complexity.</p></div>

Header space analysis can determine all packet headers that loop. We first describe how to detect generic loops and then show how to detect infinite loops, a subset of generic loops where packets loop indefinitely. An example of a generic, but finite loop, is an IP packet that loops until the TTL decrements to zero. Generic Loops: Given a network transfer function, we detect all loops by injecting an all-x test packet header <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: An example network for running the loop detection algorithm. The solid lines show the changes in the all-x test packet injected from A 1 till it returns to the injection port as hret.

Since we repeat the same procedure starting at every port, we will detect the same loop when we inject a test packet from P ret . Ignoring Case 2 avoids reporting the same loop twice. We find loops using breadth first search on the propagation graph. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> we inject the all-x test packet into port A 1 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> is the correspond- <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> While we could define a loop as a packet returning to a node visited earlier, using ports helps detect infinite loops. ing propagation graph.

For example, in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">{(H 3 , B 1 ), (H 4 , D 2 )} = Φ(H 2 , C 0 ).</formula><p>We detect a loop when Port is the first element of Visits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The generic loop detection test has the same algorithmic structure as reachability test, and hence its complexity is similarly O(dP R <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, the header space changes as the test packet traverses the loop.

Now, h ret and h orig relate in one of three ways:</p><p>1. h ret ∩ h orig = φ: In this case, the loop is surely finite. The header space that caused the loop, i.e. h orig , does not intersect with the returned header space, and the loop will terminate.</p><p>2. h ret ⊆ h orig : in this case the loop is certainly infinite. Every packet header in h orig is mapped by the transfer function of the loop to a point in h ret . Since h ret is completely within h orig , the process will repeat in the next round, and the loop will continue indefinitely.</p><p>3. Neither of the above: In this case, we need to iterate again. First, note that h ret − h orig completely satisfies Case 1's condition, and therefore cannot loop again. But we must examine h ret ∩ h orig . So we redefine h ret := h ret ∩ h orig and calculate the new h orig . We repeat until one of the first two cases happens. The process must terminate (in at most 2 L steps) because at each step the newly defined h ret shrinks. Hence, eventually case 1 or 2 will happen, or h ret will be empty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> More tortuous loops, where a packet passes through other loops before coming back to a first loop, can also be detected using a simple generalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Slice Isolation</head><p>Network operators often wish to control which groups of hosts (or users) can communicate with each other.</p><p>They might define the traffic belonging to a slice using VLANs, MPLS, FlowVisor, or -as far as we are concerned -any set of headers. A common requirement is that traffic stay within its slice, and not leak to another slice. Leakage might cause a malfunction or lead to a security breach.</p><p>Header space analysis can (1) Help create new slices that are guaranteed to be isolated, and can (2) Detect when slices are leaking traffic. We consider each use case in turn.</p><p>Creating New Slices: Creating a new slice requires identification of a region of network space that does not overlap with regions belonging to existing slices. Consider an example of two slices, a and b with regions of network space N a , N b ∈ N ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">N a = {(α i , p i )] pi∈S } , N b = {(β i , p i )] pi∈S }</formula><p>where α are headers in N a and β are headers in N b , and p i ∈ S are individual ports in each slice.</p><p>If the two slices do not overlap, they have no header space in common on any common port, i.e., α i ∩ β i = φ, for all i. If they intersect, we can determine precisely where (which links) and how (which headers) by finding their intersection:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">N a ∩ N b = {(α i ∩ β i , p i )] pi∈Na&amp;pi∈N b }.</formula><p>Set intersection could, for example, be used to statically verify that communication is allowed at one layer, or with one protocol but not with another. A simple check for overlap is extremely useful in any slicing environment (e.g. VLANs or FlowVisor) to check for run-time violations. The test can flag violations, or could be be used to create one slice to monitor another.</p><p>Detecting Leakage. Even if two slices do not overlap anywhere, packets can still leak from one slice to another when headers are rewritten. We can use a (more involved) algorithm to check whether packets can leak. If there is leakage, the algorithm finds the set of offending (header, port) pairs.</p><p>Assume that slice a has reserved network space N a = { (α i , p i )] pi∈S }, and the network transfer function of slice a is Ψ a (h, p). Slice a is only allowed to control packets belonging to its slice using Ψ a . Leakage occurs when a packet in slice a at any switch-port can be rewritten to fall into the network space of another slice. If packets cannot leak at any switch-port, then they cannot leak anywhere. Therefore on each switch-port, we apply the network transfer function of slice a to its header space reservation, to generate all possible packet headers from slice a. Call this the output header set. If the output header space of slice a at any switch port, overlaps with any other slice, then there is the potential for leaks. Although slice a and b have disjoint slice reservation on S 1 and S 2 , but slice a's reservation on S 1 can leak to slice b's reservation os S 2 after it is rewritten by slice a's transfer function rules.</p><p>[1] shows that the complexity of both tests is O <ref type="figure">(W 2 N )</ref>, where W is the maximum number of wildcard expressions used to describe any slice's reservation and N is the total number of slices in the network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Implementation</head><p>We created a set of tools written in Python 2.6 -called Header Space Library or Hassel -that implement the techniques described above. The source code is available here <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Hassel's basic building block is a header space object that is a union of wildcard expressions which implements basic set operations. In Hassel, transfer function objects that implement network transfer functions are configured by a set of rules; when given a header space object and port, a transfer function generates a list of output header space objects and ports. Transfer functions can be built from standard rules (i.e. by matching on an input port and wildcard expression), or from custom rules supplied by the programmer. Hassel allows the computation of the inverse of a transfer function. We also wrote a Cisco IOS parser that parse router configurations and command outputs and generates a transfer function object that models the static behavior of the router. The resulting automation was essential in analyzing Stanford's network. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> is a block diagram of Hassel. For Cisco routers, we first use Cisco IOS commands to show the MAC-address table, the ARP Table, the Spanning Tree, the IP forwarding table, and the router configuration. The result is passed to the parser which builds transfer function objects which are then used by applications such as Loop Detection.</p><p>Our implementation employs five key optimizations marked with superscript indices in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> that are keyed to the rows in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. We briefly describe all optimizations, defering details to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>    <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> to reduce the number of transfer function rules.</p><p>Lazy Subtraction: The simple geometric model, which assumes the rules in the transfer function are disjoint, can dramatically increase the number of rules. For example, if a router has two destination IP addresses: 10.1.1.x and 10.1.x.x and uses longest prefix match, our original definition requires the second entry to be converted to 8 disjoint rules. To avoid this, we extended the notion of a header space object to accept a union of wildcard expressions minus a union of wildcard expressions: ∪{w i } − ∪{w j }. Then, when we want to apply 10.1.x.x rule to the input header space, we simply subtract from the final result, the output generated by the first rule. Lazy subtraction allows delaying the expansion of terms during intermediate steps, only doing so at the end. As the table suggests, performance is dramatically improved.</p><p>Dead Object Deletion: At intermediate steps, header space objects often evaluate to empty, and should be removed. Lazy subtraction masks such empty objects; so we added a quick test to detect empty header space objects without explicit subtraction.</p><p>Lookup Based Search: To pass an input header space through a transfer function object, we must find which transfer function rules match the input header space. We avoid inefficient linear search via a lookup table that returns all wildcard rules that may intersect with the (possibly wildcarded) search key. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> we described the details of how we implemented such a table.</p><p>Lazy Evaluation of Transfer Function Rules: It is possible for the header space to grow as the cross-product of the rules. For example, if some boxes forward based on D destination address, while others filter based on S source IP address, the network transfer function can have D × S fragments. If two transfer functions are orthogonal, HSL uses commutativity of transfer functions to delay computation of one set of rules until the end.</p><p>Bookmarking Applied Transfer Function Rules: Both reachability and loop detection tests, require tracing backwards using the inverse transfer function. HSL "bookmarks" or memoizes the specific transfer rules applied to a header space object along the forward path. HSL saves time during the reverse path computation by only inverting the bookmarked rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Evaluation</head><p>In this section, we first demonstrate the functionality of Hassel on Stanford University's backbone network and report performance results of our reachability and loop detection algorithms on an enterprise network. Then we benchmark the performance of our slice isolation test on random slices created on Stanford backbone network which are similar to the existing VLAN slices. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our approach to new protocols. All of our tests are run on a Macbook Pro, with Intel core i7, 2.66Ghz quad core CPU and 4GB of RAM. Only two of the cores were in use during the tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Verification Of An Enterprise Network</head><p>We ran Hassel on Stanford University's backbone network. With a population of over 15,000 students, 2,000 faculty, and five /16 IPv4 subnets, Stanford is a relatively large enterprise network. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the network that connects departments and student dorms to the outside word. There are 14 operational zone (OZ) routers at the bottom connected via 10 switches to 2 backbone routers which connect Stanford to the outside world. Overall, the network has more than 757,000 forwarding entries and 1,500 ACL rules. We do not provide exact IP addresses or ports to meet privacy concerns.</p><p>We had two experimental goals: we wished to demonstrate the utility of running Hassel checks, and we wished to measure Hassel's performance in a production network. When we generated box transfer functions, we chose not to include learned MAC address of end hosts. This allowed us to unearth problems that can be masked by learned MAC addresses but may surface when learned entries expire.</p><p>Checking for loops: We ran the loop detection test on the entire backbone network by injecting test packets from 30 ports. It took 151 seconds to compress the forwarding table and generate transfer functions, and 560 seconds to run loop detection test for all 30 ports. IP table compression reduced the forwarding entries to around 4,200. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The loop detection test found 12 infinite loop paths (ignoring TTL), such as path L1 in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, for packets destined to 10 different IP addresses. These loops are caused by interaction between spanning tree protocols of two VLANs: a packet broadcast on VLAN 1 can reach the leaves of the spanning tree of VLAN 1, where IP forwarding on a leaf nodes forwards it to VLAN 2. Then, the packet is broadcasted on VLAN 2 and is forwarded at the leaf of VLAN 2 back to the original VLAN where the process can continue.</p><p>Although IP TTL will terminate this process, if the TTL is 32 and the normal path length is 3, this con-7 There were 4 routers which together had 733,000 forwarding entries because no default BGP route was received. As a result they kept one entry for every Internet subnet they knew of, but all with the same output port. IP compression reduced their table size by 3 orders of magnitude. sumes 10 times the normal resources during looping periods. More importantly, it shows how protocol interactions can lead to subtle problems. Each VLAN has a separate spanning tree that prevents loops but VLANs are often defined manually. More generally, individual protocols often contain automated mechanisms that guarantee correctness for the protocol by itself, but the interaction between protocols is often done manually. Such manual configuration often leads to errors which Hassel can check for; route redistribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> provides another example of how manual connection of different routing protocols can lead to errors.</p><p>We also found 4 other loop paths, similar to L1, L2 and L3 in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> for packets destined to 16 subnets. However, these loops were single-round loops, because when the packets return to the injection port, they are assigned to a VLAN not defined on that box, and hence will be dropped.  Detecting possible configuration mistakes: As a second example, we considered a configuration mistake that could cause packets to loop between backbone router 1 and the Internet. Stanford owns the IP subnet 171.64.0.0/14. But not all of these IP addresses are currently in use. The backbone routers have an entry to route those IP addresses that are in use, to the correct OZ router. Also, the default route in the backbone routers (0.0.0.0/0) is to send packets to the internet. To avoid sending packets destined to the unused Stanford IP addresses to the outside world, the backbone routers have a manually installed null rule that drops all packets destined to 171.64.0.0/14, if they don't match any other rule.</p><p>Suppose that by mistake the null rule is set to drop 171.64.0.0/16 IP addresses (i.e., the /14 is fat-fingered to a /16). Assume that the ISP's router does not filter incoming traffic traffic from Stanford destined to Stanford. Then packets sent to unused addresses in 17.64.0.0/14 that are not in 171.64.0.0/16 will loop between the backbone routers and the ISP's router. We simulated this scenario, and the test successfully detected the loop in less than 10 minutes (as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>). More importantly, the tool allowed the loop to be traced to the line in the configuration file that caused the error. In particular, the tool output shows that packets in the loop match the default 0.0.0.0/0 forwarding rule and not the 171.64.0.0/16 rule in the backbone router.</p><p>Verifying reachability to an OZ router: As a third example, we calculated the reachability function from the OZ router connected to the student dorms to the OZ router connected to the CS department. We verified that all the intended security restrictions, as commented by the admin in the config file were met. These restrictions included ports and IP addresses that were closed to outside users. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> shows the run time for this test. We have heard from managers that many restrictions and ACLs were inserted by earlier managers and are still preserved because current managers are afraid to remove them. Hassel allows managers to do "What if" analysis to see the effect of deleting an ACL. We would like to understand how quickly we can create new and flexible slices on-demand in the Stanford network. Recall from Section 5.3, we need to perform two checks:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Checking Slice Isolation</head><p>1. When creating a slice, we need to make sure its header space does not overlap with an existing slice. 2. Whenever a rewrite action is added to a slice, we need to check that it cannot cause packet leakage.</p><p>We generated random slices with a topology similar to the existing VLANs, as follows: for each slice, we randomly pick two operational zones in Stanford together with all router ports and switches that connect them. Then we add random pieces of header space to each slice by picking X source or destination subnets of random prefix length (or random TCP ports) to union together. X, the number of wildcard expressions used to describe a slice, denotes the slice's complexity. While all existing VLAN slices in Stanford require fewer than 10 wildcard expressions 8 , we explored the limits of performance by varying X from 10 to 1, 000. We ran experiments to create new slices of varying complexity, X, while there were 10, 100 or 500 existing slices.</p><p>In the first experiment, we create a new slice, and the checker verifies isolation by looking for intersection with all the existing slices. This test is done every time a new slice is created, and we hope it will complete in a few minutes or less. In the second experiment, we emulate the behavior of adding a new rewrite action. We generate random rewrite actions, and the checker checks to see if it could possibly cause a packet leak to another slice. This test has to be run every time a new rule is added, so it needs to be really fast. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> and 9 shows the run time of our tests. As the figures suggest, if the slices are not very complex (can be explained with fewer than 50 wildcard expressions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , then the tests run almost instantly. Surprisingly, the tests are very fast even when there are 500 slices: more than adequate for existing networks. If there are only 10 or 100 slices, the checks can be done on very complex slices. The experimental run times matches the expected complexity in Section 5.3, which is quadratic in the number of wildcard expressions per slice and linear in the number of slices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Debugging a Protocol Design</head><p>This section describes a plausible scenario in which a loop is caused by a protocol design mistake. The scenario allows the loop size to be parameterized to examine how detection time varies with loop size. It also showcases how HSL can model IP options and other variable length fields using custom transfer function rules.</p><p>In our scenario, Alice -a networking researcher -invents a new loose source routing protocol, IP*. IP* allows a source to specify the sequence of middle boxes that a packet must pass through. Alice's protocol has the header format shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>.a. IP* works exactly like normal IP, except that it updates the header at the first router where a packet enters the IP* network. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  10</ref>.b shows an example of header update for a stack size of three. The header update operation sets the current source address to the "sender IP address" field, rewrites the destination IP address to the address at the top of the stack, and rotates all the IP addresses in the stack. After processing, a destination middlebox swaps the destination and source IP addresses and resends the packet to a router. Alice designs IP* to allow tunneling across existing IP networks.</p><p>Alice tries IP* in the network topology of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> and verifies that packets are successfully routed via middle boxes M 1 and M 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> also shows how the packet header changes as it passes through M 1 and M 2 to final destination DST in 6 steps. At DST , the stack contains the IP address of all middleboxes visited.</p><p>To continue her verification of IP*, Alice tries the more complex network in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> where the destination is attached to a different IP* network than the source. Instead of deploying a real network, she uses the loop detection algorithm from Section 5.2 and finds several loops. The most interesting one is an infinite loop consisting of the two strange loops below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">1) R 2 → R 5 → M 2 → R 5 → R 2 → R 4 → M 1 → 9</formula><p>This includes wildcard expressions that are included in, or excluded from, the definition of a slice.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>: Example of an IP* network where a packet sent from SRC to DST visits middleboxes M 1 and M 2. The figure labels 6 steps of packet processing along with the transformed header at each step. R2 is the entry point to the IP* network which performs IP* header updates.</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">R 4 → R 2 → R 3 → R 6 → R 3 → R 2 2) R 2 → R 4 → M 1 → R 4 → R 2 → R 5 → M 2 → R 5 → R 2 → R 3 → R 6 → R 3 → R 2</formula><p>Alice now realizes that having a second IP* network in the path can cause loops. She removes the concept of a "first" router, instead adding a pointer that describes the middlebox to visit next. We should be clear that by no means are we proposing IP* as a viable protocol. Instead, we hope this example suggests that Hassel could be a useful tool for protocol designers as well as network managers. While this particular loop could be caught by a simulation, if there were many sources and destinations and the loop was caused by a more obscure pre- condition, then a simulation may not uncover the loop. By contrast, static checking using Hassel will find all loops. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows the per-port performance of our infinite loop detection algorithm for the ports participating in the loops. We varied the number of middle boxes connected to R 2 (e.g., M 1 and M 2) and the number of router forwarding entries. For four middle boxes, the loop has a length of 72 nodes! Finding a large and complex loop in less than four minutes -for a network with 100,000 forwarding rules and custom actions -using less than 50 lines 10 of python code (figure 14) demonstrates the power of the Header Space framework.</p></div>

It is no panacea, serving as one tool among many needed by protocol designers, software developers, and network operators. For example, while header space analysis might tell us that a routing algorithm is broken because routing tables are inconsistent, it does not tell us why. Even if the routing tables are consistent, header space analysis offers no clues as to whether routing is efficient or meets the objectives of the designer. Despite this, header space analysis could play a similar role in networks as post-layout verification tools do in chip design, or static analysis checkers do in compilation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="10">Conclusions</head><p>Our paper introduces Header Space Analysis: a general framework for reasoning about arbitrary protocols, and for finding common failures, or accidents. By parsing routing and configuration tables automatically, we show that header space analysis can be used in existing networks where protocol interactions are increasingly complex. As we saw in the Stanford backbone and noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, while individual protocols use automated mechanisms to prevent internal problems, managing many protocols simultaneously is a manual and error-prone business. Header Space Analysis can also be used in emerging networks, where new protocols can be added dynamically. It can give network operators the confidence to adopt new protocols, or new slicing mechanisms -the framework can be used to create comprehensive checkers that can be used by network operators to pro-actively avoid (or retroactively investigate) accidents.</p><p>Our personal story is that we set out to create a geometric model to better understand slicing. Along the way, we discovered how simple it is to analyze networks using Network Transfer Functions (Ψ). We found that checking for a given violation was surprisingly easy when expressed using this high level abstraction, allowing elegant expression and simple implementation as our code snippets (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14)</ref> suggest.</p><p>We have work to do to improve the performance of our prototype Hassel implementation. A first round of optimization reduced running time by five orders of magnitude, making Hassel perform well for production networks with a few dozen routers, adequate for most enterprises and campuses. With simple fixes (e.g. exploiting 64-bit arithmetic, using compiled languages rather than Python, and harnessing the parallelism of multicore chips) we expect another 2-3 orders of magnitude performance gain. We expect running time of a complete loop test for a campus backbone to be reduced from about 1,000 seconds to less than 10 seconds. Even more optimizations are apparent, such as using a Karnaugh-Map to reduce the size of header space after each transformation. There is also scope for checking updates incrementally, by analyzing loops and reachability once, and then seeing how a new rule (or slice) changes the result.</p><p>We have other work ahead of us: we would like to create tools that create test packets to dynamically sample header space to detect faults in an operational network.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">Related Work</head><p>The notion of a transfer function in our work is similar to ASE mapping defined in axiomatic routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, where the authors develop tools to analyze a variety of protocols. Header space analysis makes no attempt to analyze protocols; instead, it tackles the problem of independently checking if their output creates conflicts. Roscoe's predicate routing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> introduces the notion of pushing a test packet (as used in our reachability and loop detection algorithms) when designing routing mechanisms, rather than for static checking as we do. Xie's reachability analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> uses test packets to determine reachability (not loop detection) for the special case of TCP/IP networks. The static analysis tools described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> are designed specifically for TCP/IP firewalls, and Feamster's work in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> finds reachability failures in BGP routers.</p><p>Header space analysis is broader in two ways. First, it is a framework that can identify a range of network configuration problems. Second, the algorithms developed in this framework are independent of protocols. Finally, note that model checking, SAT solvers, and Theorem Provers are other commonly used frameworks for veri-</p></div>
