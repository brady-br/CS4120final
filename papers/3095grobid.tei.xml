				<p>Supporting real-time jobs on MapReduce systems is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity of the environment , the load imbalance caused by skewed data blocks, as well as real-time response demands imposed by the applications. In this paper we describe our approach for scheduling real-time, skewed MapReduce jobs in heterogeneous systems. Our approach comprises the following components: (i) a distributed scheduling algorithm for scheduling real-time MapReduce jobs end-to-end, and (ii) techniques for handling the data skew-ness that frequently arises in MapReduce environments and can lead to significant load imbalances. Our detailed experimental results using real datasets on a truly heterogeneous environment, Planetlab, illustrate that our approach is practical, exhibits good performance and consistently outperforms its competitors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Today, we are experiencing increased demand for processing large amounts of data-intensive tasks. Systems such as IBM's InfoSphere BigInsights <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, Amazon's DynamoDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Google's MapReduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, have rapidly become de facto big data processing frameworks. These systems need to be fast, scalable and highly available. In particular, Google's MapReduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> framework has been proposed as a powerful and cost-effective approach for massive-scale processing. It has been utilized by some of the major computing companies, including Amazon, eBay, Facebook, IBM, LinkedIn, Twitter and Yahoo!, via its open-source implementation Hadoop <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> in a wide variety of application domains including realtime analysis of sensor data streams, real-time stock market data analysis and financial trading applications.</p><p>The MapReduce model breaks intense processing jobs into smaller tasks that run in parallel on multiple machines. Jobs are split into two stages of processing, map Different values corresponding to the same key are then aggregated, and each key along with its associated values are transmitted to the reduce phase for further data processing. The partitioning of the intermediate <ref type="bibr">(key, value)</ref> pairs to the reduce tasks is based on a partitioning function, which in most cases is a simple hash function. However, partitions (i.e., the set of intermediate <ref type="bibr">(key, value)</ref> pairs that will be processed by the same reduce task) can be of varying size, leading to significant data skewness challenges and critical delays on the execution times of the corresponding reduce tasks.</p><p>We use the following example to illustrate the load imbalances that can occur due to skewness (i.e., partitions of varying sizes) as well as the effect on the execution times of the tasks, when processing skewed dataintensive MapReduce tasks. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the distribution of the partitions' sizes and the corresponding execution times of the reduce tasks for a MapReduce job that processes a Youtube social graph (detailed information about the experiment can be found in the experimental evaluation section). The experiment run on Planetlab, using 82 processing cores and applying the hash function (hashcode(key)modR, where R is the number of reduce tasks) proposed in the original MapReduce framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The figure clearly depicts that the exhibited skewness of the partition sizes affects the execution time of reduce tasks due to the uneven distribution of the data.</p><p>The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that jobs often have real-time response requirements, in the form of deadlines. As was pointed out by a recent study on Facebook's and Yahoo!'s production workload traces, 95% percentage of their production jobs are short running with an average real-time response requirement of 30 seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Timely execution of the tasks is a challenging problem due to the large heterogeneity and resource sharing in the nodes; in a shared processing environment, the execution times of the jobs are greatly affected by multiple tasks invoked concurrently and asynchronously by many jobs that are executed on the same computing resources. Conditions such as slow or misbehaving tasks (i.e., due to hardware failures or misconfiguration), can severely affect the performance of the entire jobs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Nevertheless, to make the deployment of these systems practical, the jobs must be able to operate autonomously in highly dynamic environments, and meet real-time demands, even under load spikes and unpredictable initiation of new tasks.</p><p>Current scheduling techniques in the Hadoop MapReduce framework (the most widely used MapReduce implementation) are not adequate, as they either adopt Fair scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref> or Capacity scheduling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>. These strive to balance the load across the resources rather than meeting real-time demands of the jobs. Recent approaches for scheduling MapReduce jobs include the LATE <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[42]</ref> and EDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ref> schedulers, however both approaches focus on scheduling and do not examine the impact of skewed data on the execution time of jobs. With respect to the skewed partitions problem, work has been mainly done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. The first aims at distributing similar sized partitions among the available reduce tasks, but in heterogeneous environments this approach can lead to the assignment of large-size partitions to slow nodes. Skewtune <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> on the other side, proposes the repartitioning of heavily skewed partitions, however the overhead of such schemes can degrade the performance of short running jobs. It is clear that none of the existing works offers a unified solution for the two problems but rather examines them separately without taking into account their interaction.</p><p>In this work, we present DynamicShare, our system for supporting the execution of real-time, skewed MapReduce jobs in heterogeneous environments. Our goal is to address the joint problem of: (a) scheduling MapReduce jobs dynamically to maximize the probability of meeting their real-time response requirements, and (b) effectively handle the issue of data skewness. We focus on the execution of short running jobs, similar to Facebook Corona <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>, (typical queries are: identify common friends in Facebook), which execute in the order of seconds. To our knowledge this is the first proposal towards a unified solution to the stated problem.</p><p>Our approach makes the following contributions:</p><p>1. We present a distributed scheduling algorithm for scheduling jobs end-to-end. DynamicShare uses measurements of laxity values of the tasks, projected latencies and measurements of resource loads to adjust their scheduling order to compensate for queuing delays, estimates the execution times of the tasks using a non-parametric regression technique and identifies overloaded nodes early on through a Local Outlier Factor algorithm.</p><p>2. To handle the data skewness that arises in the reduce phase, we design two algorithms, a simple but efficient Simple Partitions' assignment algorithm that considers the sizes of the partitions and the variable processing capabilities of the nodes to make an appropriate placement, and a Count-Min sketches algorithm that enables an even better distribution of the partitions but at the expense of additional execution time for the partitions' assignment procedure.</p><p>3. We have implemented and evaluated DynamicShare on Planetlab, a truly heterogeneous environment, using 82 processing cores in total. Our experimental results utilizing two different datasets, from Youtube and Twitter networks, illustrate that our approach is practical, meets jobs' real-time response demands, effectively addresses the issue of highly skewed data, and outperforms its competitors.</p><p>2 System Model and Architecture</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">System Model</head><p>A MapReduce job is modelled as a sequence of invocations of M map and R reduce tasks (shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Tasks are modelled as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">map(k 1 , v 1 ) ⇒ [k 2 , v 2 ] and reduce(k 2 , [v 2 ]) ⇒ [k 3 , v 3 ]</formula><p>. Map tasks take as input (k 1 , v 1 ) pairs and return a list of (key,value) pairs of possibly different types, k 2 and v 2 . The values associated with the same key k 2 are grouped together into a list and passed as input to the appropriate reduce task, which emits arbitrary (key,value) pairs of a final type, k 3 and v 3 . All</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(k 2 , [v 2 ]</formula><p>) pairs processed by the same reduce task on a cluster's node, are considered a partition. Recent works, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, suggest the usage of a larger number of partitions compared to the number of reduce tasks to minimize the skewness of the intermediate data. Our framework follows this approach. We consider soft real-time MapReduce jobs that are aperiodic and, thus, their arrival times are not known a priori. We focus on applications with intensive reduce phase and limited network transfers. Each job j is associated with a number of parameters: Deadline j is the time interval, starting at job initiation, within which job j must complete (deadline values are typically assigned by a system administrator based on the real-time demands of the jobs, determining the appropriate deadline for the job is outside the scope of the paper). Pro j exec time j is the estimated amount of time required for the job to complete, this includes communication and queueing times at the system resources. Every job j should execute within its Deadline j , that is, the sum of the computation times and the corresponding communication times of all tasks invoked by the job (denoted as projected end-to-end execution time) should be smaller than the Deadline j . MapReduce jobs are data-intensive jobs, thus, the endto-end execution time is mainly attributed to the execution times of the tasks and the communication times are negligible. Laxity j is defined as the difference between the Deadline j and Pro j exec time j , and is considered as a measure of urgency for the j job. The laxity value for each job is updated dynamically during execution; and determines the order with which the job's tasks will be scheduled at the system resources. Finally, split size j is the user-defined size of a split input file for job j.</p><p>Each task t of job j is described with the following metrics: cpu i,t and memory i,t represent the average percentage of CPU and memory required for task t to execute on Worker i. m i,t is the estimated mean execution time of a map task on Worker i. This includes the required time to read the total amount of input data, execute the map method and transmit the intermediate pairs to the reduce tasks. Similarly, r i,t depicts the estimated execution time of a reduce task, this corresponds to the time required for grouping (key, value) pairs with the same key into a single (key,list o f values) pair, plus the required time for executing the reduce method. Finally partitions size i,t holds the total size of the partitions that are assigned on Worker i for a reduce task t.</p></div>

It is responsible for the assignment of the map and reduce tasks to Workers and the monitoring of the currently executing jobs. For each submitted job, the Master estimates the execution times of the map and reduce tasks in order to compute the execution time of the whole job and its corresponding laxity value. This value will be used by the TaskScheduler component at each Worker when scheduling the job's tasks (Section III). The Master is responsible to keep track of current resource usage statistics (i.e., CPU, memory) along with their respective laxity values, as reported by the Monitor components at the individual Worker nodes during task execution. This information will also be used by the anomaly detection algorithm to identify overloaded nodes. The Master invokes the partitions' assignment algorithm to decide how to distribute the generated partitions to the available reduce tasks (Section IV). Finally, the input data file for each job is uploaded to the cluster and distributed as equal sized split files to the Workers for processing by the map tasks; the size of the split file is typically user-defined. Techniques such as the one proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> can further enhance our framework to distribute the split files based on the processing capabilities of the nodes in the cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Dynamic Real-Time Scheduling of MapReduce Jobs</head><p>We develop a distributed scheduling approach that dynamically adjusts the execution of jobs on the system resources and measures the impact of overloaded nodes on meeting their end-to-end real-time demands. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Estimating Execution Times of Tasks</head><p>To estimate the execution times of the entire jobs, the fundamental idea is to compute an approximation of the execution times of the map and reduce tasks and use this approximation in the computation of the execution time of the entire job. Techniques for estimating the execution time of MapReduce jobs, such as building job profiles based on previous execution times <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref> or using debug runs before the actual execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> have been proposed for homogeneous environments, but without examining the implications of the problem in a heterogeneous setting, where the execution times of the tasks may vary.</p><p>We propose an estimation model that considers both the resource requirements of the newly submitted tasks and the previous task runs. There are two main approaches to address this: with parametric or nonparametric techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[40]</ref>. For each map task we maintain a vector − → x of the task parameters as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">− → x = (split size j , cpu i,t , memory i,t )</formula><p>Similarly, for reduce tasks we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">− → x = (partitions size i,t , cpu i,t , memory i,t )</formula><p>The cpu i,t , memory i,t requirements of a newly submitted task are estimated via a histogram based approach similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. This approach is based on past runs. It distributes the processing requirements of previous tasks into histogram bins and utilizes the mean of the most populated bin for estimating the requirements of the newly issued task. If we model the execution time using parametric regression, the functional form of the m( − → x ) is assumed known and a technique like Least Squares can be applied for the calculation of the polynomial coefficients. However, in the case of a highly dynamic environment, like our setting, computing the execution time of tasks via a polynomial function is not efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. Thus, in such environments non-parametric techniques are more appropriate.</p><p>In non-parametric regression no assumption can be made about the functional form of m( − → x ), therefore the estimation is regarded as data driven because it depends only on previous task runs. All non-parametric regression techniques are modelled by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ˆ m( − → x ) = 1 n n ∑ i=1 W i ( − → x )y i (1)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W i ( − → x )</formula><p>is a weighting sequence and y i the execution time of a previously issued task. Essentially, thêthê m( − → x ) can be considered as the weighted average of n previous task runs. Special care must be given to the number of previous runs that will be used. Too many past runs can lead to overly biased results, on the other hand few examples make the curve too "noisy". In our previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> we have shown that the number of runs to use depends on the job's characteristics.</p><p>The non-parametric regression technique we decided to implement for our estimation problem was k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) smoothing. In k-NN smoothing, the estimation ofˆmofˆ ofˆm( − → x ) is based on the k past runs that are closest to the given vector − → x . Utilizing a subset of the past runs, instead of all n past runs, is important because only those that have similar resource requirements with the currently examining task are considered in the estimation, and thus a better prediction is possible. We use the Euclidean distance of vectors to identify the closest past runs. In order to achieve better estimations, the impact of the previous runs on the estimation is weighted based on their distance from the examining vector, with the ones being closer receiving higher weights. A weighting function with several optimality properties is the Epanechnikov kernel K(d), where:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">K(d) = 3 4 (1 − d 2 )</formula><p>, with |d| &lt; 1. The d parameter, in our case is the calculated Euclidean distance of the vectors. The choice of the kernel function is not significant for the results of the approximation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. The Epanechnikov kernel function gives more weight to previous runs that are closer to the examining task's vector parameters. In order to be utilized by the estimator, the function must be scaled and normalized. We used the following weighting function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">W i ( − → x ) = 񮽙 K R (| − → x − − → x i |) ˆ f ( − → x ) if i ∈ N− → x 0 otherwise (2)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">N− → x = {i: − → x i is one of the k nearest neighbors of − → x }, K R (d) is the scaled Epanechnikov kernel function</formula><p>and is given by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">K R (d) = 1 R K( d R )</formula><p>. The kernel is scaled by the factor R which is defined as: <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> is a normalized factor, and is given by the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">R = max(| − → x − − → x i |), i ∈ N− → x . Finally thê f ( − → x ) factor in equation</formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">ˆ f ( − → x ) = 1 k ∑ − → x i ∈N− → x K R (| − → x − − → x i |).</formula><p>One important aspect of the algorithm is the choice of the value for k that will determine the number of past runs to be taken into account during the estimation. Too many examples can cause an increase on the bias E{ˆmE{ˆ E{ˆm( − → x ) − m( − → x )}, while few previous runs may lead to large variance E{ˆmE{ˆ E{ˆm 2 ( − → x )}. The value of k depends on the number n, so it must be adjusted accordingly. It has been proven <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[40]</ref> that by increasing k in proportion to n 4 5 , the k-NN technique achieves a constant balance between the variance and the bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Least Laxity First Scheduling</head><p>We develop a dynamic, distributed least laxity first scheduling scheme that determines the order of execution of the tasks based on their urgencies and timing constraints. The Least Laxity First Scheduling (LLF) algorithm has been successfully employed in distributed and mobile real-time systems such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. In LLF each job is associated with a laxity value, that represents a measure of urgency for the job and is used to order the execution of the tasks on the Workers. Given the dead-line Deadline j and Pro j exec time j for job j, we compute Laxity j as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Laxity j = Deadline j − Pro j exec time j ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>The projected execution time of j job is computed based on its estimates of the execution times of the map and reduce tasks, as follows: Pro j exec time j = max{m i,t , ..., m k,t } + max{r z,t , ..., r l,t }, where we consider the maximum execution times of the map and reduce tasks in the above computation since all tasks of the same phase run in parallel. The laxity value for each job is computed initially by the Master node and is used when scheduling the tasks of the job at each node. The closer the Laxity j value to zero, the more probable is for the job to miss its deadline; a negative value indicates that the deadline will be missed. Tasks are ordered in the TaskScheduler at each node, based on the laxity values of the jobs that invoke them. The advantage of LLF compared to other scheduling approaches such as Earliest Deadline First (EDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ref> and Hadoop's FIFO and FAIR scheduler, is, that, LLF is a dynamic scheduling algorithm that allows for compensating for queueing delays often experienced in distributed settings or that were mis-calculated at previous nodes. In LLF the task with the smallest laxity value has the higher priority. The laxity value of a job is adjusted as the tasks invoked by the job execute on the system resources. To avoid constantly updating the laxity values for a job, they are adjusted only when new tasks are inserted into the TaskScheduler's queue or when tasks finish execution or miss their deadlines. As the laxity values of the jobs are updated, the task belonging to the job with the smallest laxity value will execute next; if a job has negative laxity value this job has been estimated to miss its deadline and thus its tasks will be processed only when the TaskScheduler has pending tasks that all have missed their deadlines. That means a task with negative laxity will never preempt tasks with positive laxity values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Identifying Overloaded Nodes</head><p>Because nodes' resource capacities are not directly correlated to the amount of data they are assigned for processing, it is possible that the data blocks are distributed unproportionally to the nodes. This may result in Workers becoming overloaded and not capable of completing their assigned tasks within the jobs' deadlines.</p><p>To identify overloaded Workers early on, we use the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> on the laxity values of tasks of the same job that run on different Workers. LOF is a metric of anomaly detection that can be applied to a set and identify possible outliers. We consider as outliers, laxity values that significantly differ from the rest. Our goal is to proactively identify overloaded Workers before the laxity value of the corresponding job becomes negative.</p><p>The main idea of the LOF algorithm is to compare the local density of a point's neighbourhood with respect to the local density of its neighbours, seeking one or more points with significant difference from the rest. Thus, we compare the laxity values for the same job on the different Workers that execute the tasks of the job. More formally: Let l distance(lax A ) be the distance of a lax A to the l nearest neighbour, lax A will be the laxity value of a job j that runs on a Worker that can possibly be overloaded. We denote the l nearest laxity values as N l (lax A ). This distance is used to define the reachability distance metric: reach d l (lax A , lax B ) := max{l distance(lax B ), d(lax A , lax B )}, where lax B will be the laxity value of the same j job on a different Worker. The reachability distance of a value lax A from lax B depicts the true distance of the two values (d(lax A , lax B )), but also at least the l distance of lax B . The usage of this distance achieves more stable results as shown on <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The local reachability density of lax A is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">lrd l (lax A ) := |N l (lax A )| ∑ lax B ∈N l (lax A ) reach d l (lax A , lax B )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and intuitively is the inverse of the mean reachability distance of lax A from its neighbouring laxity values. The local reachability density is then compared with those of the neighbours using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">LOF l (lax A ) := ∑ lax B ∈N l (lax A ) lrd l (lax B ) |N l (lax A )| * lrd l (lax A )<label>(5)</label></formula><p>which is the average reachability density of the neighbours divided by lax A 's own local density. A LOF value below 1 indicates a denser region, which would dictate an inlier, while values significantly greater than 1 indicate outliers. The Master utilizes formula (5) to compare the laxity values of the jobs running in the system, based on the laxity values reported by the Workers. If a value greater than 1 is detected, the corresponding node is marked as overloaded, giving the option to execute some of its tasks on a different Worker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Skewed data</head><p>As described earlier, the MapReduce framework is susceptible to severe load imbalances caused due to the skewness exhibited in the partitions. Recall, that in the original MapReduce framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a partition consists of all the intermediate pairs that give the same result when the partitioning function is applied to them. Each partition is then assigned to a different reduce task. The most commonly used partitioning function, utilized also in Hadoop, is hashcode(key) mod R. In our system two types of skewness frequently occur: Skewed Key Frequencies. This occurs when some keys appear more frequently in the intermediate pairs, thus the partition they are part of becomes extremely large. This issue can be solved by putting more work on the map tasks, by aggregating the values of the same key, and creating intermediate pairs in the form of (key, list of values). Skewed Tuple Sizes. This applies to (key, value) pairs with complex processing structures on the value field. For example in the Twitter social network there is a large assymetry in the types of users and their friendship lists, as a result, pairs have varying sizes, depending on the number of objects that occupy their lists. So this case applies to partitions for which the (key, list of values) pairs contain lists with large amount of data.</p><p>We focus on the Skewed Tuple Sizes problem, as it has the most significant impact on the execution time of reduce tasks. Recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> have shown that solving this problem is not trivial; these primarily aim at partitioning the data in such a way so that all reduce tasks finish their processing in similar times.</p><p>We propose an approach that uses more partitions than the number of reduce tasks and takes into account the partitions' sizes and our estimates on the task execution times on Worker nodes, assigning the partitions in such a way that all reduce tasks contribute to the data processing, according to their processing capabilities. We propose an approach that puts more work on powerful nodes, assigning multiple partitions on them, while exploiting the slower nodes by assigning them light-sized partitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Partition Size Calculation</head><p>We exploit two approaches to calculate the size of the partitions, the first utilizes the amount of values corresponding to the keys of a partition (similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>), while the second uses the Count-Min Sketches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> datastructure which enables the usage of more hash functions in the calculations. Simple Partitions. Assume we have p partitions, with p ≥ R. Let s m (k) be the number of values in the list of values that corresponds to key k, on a map task m, m ∈ {0, ..., M}. We define as P m (i), i ∈ {0, ..., p} the set that contains the keys of the i-th partition on the m-th map task. Then the total size for this partition on map task m will be: S m (i) = ∑ k∈P(i) s m (k).</p><p>Each map task calculates the sizes of all generated partitions and sends them to the Master node, who is responsible to aggregate these values for each partition in order to calculate its total size. So the Master computes for each partition the following value: S(i) = ∑ m∈{1,...,M} S m (i), i = {0, ..., p}. These values will be the partitions' sizes and will be utilized in the dynamic partitioning assignment algorithm (discussed in the next section). Count-Min Sketches. Our second technique for estimating the partitions' sizes is based on the use of sketches. A sketch is a synopsis data-structure utilized extensively in query-optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It provides the capability of capturing the basic features of a dataset by monitoring a significant subset. We use a special type of sketch, called Count-Min Sketch <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which is mainly used for frequency counting in data streams <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Each map task creates a local sketch which can be seen as a two-dimensional array, sketch m <ref type="bibr">[i, j]</ref>, that stores information regarding the generated key-value pairs. Each row of the array corresponds to a different hash function that can be used for the distribution of the intermediate key-value pairs to the partitions, and each column corresponds to a different partition. So, suppose that we have d rows, H = {h i , i = 1, ...d} be the set of the chosen hash functions, and p columns, the same number as the partitions that will be used. It is recommended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that the chosen hash functions need to be pairwiseindependent, so we generate d hash functions in the form of f (x) = (a * x + b) mod pr, where a, b are random integers and pr a prime number.</p><p>When a new key-value pair has been generated, then each of the d hash functions are applied to it, and for the j corresponding position in the array, a counter increases by one, because one more value will be added to this partition. Initially: sketch m [i, j] = 0, ∀i ∈ {1, ..., d}, j ∈ {1, ..., p}. So when all the intermediate pairs have been generated, we have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">sketch m [i, j] = ∑ ∀k:h i (k)= j s m (k), ∀i ∈ {1, ..., d}, j ∈ {1, ..., p}<label>(6)</label></formula><p>When all map tasks have finished, the generated sketches are emitted to the Master for the creation of the global sketch array. The global sketch will be also a d × p array, and will be populated using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">sketch[i, j] = M ∑ m=1 sketch m [i, j], ∀i ∈ {1, ..., d}, j ∈ {1, ..., p}<label>(7)</label></formula><p>This global sketch holds all the information about the partitions' sizes, and will be utilized from the partitions' assignment algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Dynamic Partitioning Algorithm</head><p>Once the partitions sizes have been estimated, the goal of the dynamic partitioning algorithm is to decide the placement of the partitions to the corresponding reduce tasks in a way that minimizes the execution time of the re-duce phase, thus increasing the possibility of jobs meeting their deadlines. Simple Partitions. In the Simple Partitions scheme, we estimate the execution time of each partition assigned on a specific reduce task, via the k-NN estimator (discussed in Section 3.1). So, we sort the partitions with respect to their sizes in descending order and try to find the reduce task with the smaller execution time. As a reduce task might have some partitions already assigned to it, we estimate whether the new assignment will still allow the end-to-end execution times of the currently scheduled tasks to be within their deadline constraints, even if we added the new partition. The sorting of the partitions ensures that the most heavy-sized will be assigned to reduce tasks which run on Workers that exhibit the best performance. Finally the Master returns the corresponding assignment to the map tasks, in order to know where to emit the generated partitions. Sketch-based approach. In the Sketch-based approach, the same procedure is applied only this time for each row of the global sketch array. The idea is to generate a partitions' assignment for each of the possible hash functions and then choose the function that achieves the least execution time. The function's assignment plan will be utilized for the actual distribution of the partitions. This approach is applicable because each row of the global sketch table can be seen as a Simple Partitions sizes model. The sketch-based approach adds an additional cost in the partitions' assignment procedure because the partitions' assignment algorithm must be applied for each row of the sketch array. On the other hand, it increases the possibility of achieving a better partitions' assignment, with respect to the execution time, because more assignment plans are considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>We have performed an extensive experimental study of our approach on Planetlab, a fully distributed heterogeneous environment, using 82 processing cores in total; one dedicated node was utilized as Master and the others were Worker nodes executing map and reduce tasks. We assume that the Master is failure-free.</p><p>Two different jobs were used for the evaluation of our DynamicShare framework. The first job was a Twitter friendship request query on 2GB of available data during the period of Jan 1, 2013 to April 30, 2013, extracted using the Streaming API 2 of Twitter <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>, where the goal of each MapReduce job was to identify the unique friends of each user, by examining the tagged and mentioned parts of a tweet. We used a total of 5,900,000 tweets, distributed to fifty-nine available processing cores, each holding about 100,000 tweets. Thus the job consisted of 59 map and 23 reduce tasks. The job was issued with two different deadlines, the first with 15, 000 ms (strict deadline) and the second with 20, 000 ms (relaxed deadline). The map tasks read the available tweets and for each tweet a (user id, list o f f riends) pair is emitted to the appropriate reduce tasks. The latter receive this input and create for each user id the set that contains his unique friends.</p><p>The second job was a friends counting application for a 39MB Youtube <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref> social graph. The goal of the job was to calculate the number of unique friends per user, that is, the degree of each node in the social graph. The dataset contained 2,987,628 edges, which were distributed to the available map slots leading to approximately 45,000 edges per map task. We used the same number of map and reduce tasks as in the Twitter job, in order to have a fair comparison between the two applications. Youtube jobs were also issued with two different deadlines, to take into account two different type of urgencies strict and relaxed, specifically as strict deadline we used 2000 ms, while as relaxed 4000 ms. These jobs represent commonly issued jobs on Facebook and Yahoo! <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> and thus demonstrate the applicability of our framework in a production workload. Accuracy of Estimation Model. In the first set of experiments we evaluated the accuracy of our estimation model. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref> we illustrate the accuracy of our model by comparing the estimated and the actual execution time of a task running on a Worker, as a function of different numbers of previous runs used for the estimation. The results are from the execution runs of one Worker, but similar results were observed for all Workers. As the figure shows, initially when we do not have any previous run of the job's task, the estimated execution time is larger than the actual execution time of the task. However, as tasks execute and more observations become available, the estimates from the k-NN estimator are close to the real one. Laxity Based Scheduling. In the second set of experiments we evaluate the benefit of the least laxity first scheduling (LLF) approach by measuring its ability to meet the deadlines of the jobs. We compared our approach with the following algorithms: (i) Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling as was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ref>, where the scheduling criteria is the deadline value, tasks with smaller deadlines will run first. (ii) First In First Out (FIFO) scheduling, where the tasks are ordered based on their arrival order (this is the default scheduling approach used of Hadoop), and (iii) Fair Scheduling (FAIR) scheduling where all tasks are scheduled round-robin so that they get equal time on the available slots. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref> we utilized Poisson job arrivals for simulating the assignment of jobs to the framework. A fixed 70% percentage of the assigned jobs had strict deadlines, while the rest had relaxed. This workload mix was used for the   We evaluated the ability of the scheduling algorithms to meet the job deadlines, for varying number of concurrently running jobs. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, for a small number of concurrent jobs, all algorithms are able to meet their deadlines. The experiment shows that at all times LLF maintains the smaller percentage of deadline misses. LLF achieves good results even for higher number of jobs, for example when 6 jobs were issued, there was a significant increase on the deadline misses on all the other algorithms due to the increase of the required execution times on some Workers, however, LLF took into account this situation and scheduled the tasks appropriately, thus maintaining few deadline misses. LOF Evaluation. We now illustrate the working of our anomaly detection algorithm. Due to lack of space we present only the results for the Youtube jobs (as was expected, Twitter jobs had similar results). In <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> we display a snapshot of the LOF's execution. The algorithm identifies overloaded nodes by examining each task's estimated laxity value, under normal operation tasks of the same job in different Worker nodes would have similar laxity values. In <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> you see that the majority of the tasks have laxity values close to 1650 ms. However, five tasks have significant lower laxity values resulting to an increase of their lo f values and the characterization of the corresponding Workers as overloaded.</p><p>We also examine the overhead of the LOF algorithm in terms of its execution time. The execution time is mainly affected by the number of tasks that report their laxity values and need to be examined. So we run multiple Youtube jobs with varying number of tasks and report LOF's required execution times (shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). As expected, the execution time increases with the number of tasks. However, the figure shows that the algorithm takes only a few milliseconds to execute, even when it examines 84 tasks. Dynamic Partitioning. In the last set of experiments we point out the benefits of our proposed partitions' assignment algorithm, Dynamic Partitioning (DP), with respect to handling skewed intermediate data on the Twitter and Youtube jobs. To avoid the key frequencies skewness, map tasks merge for each key all the values into a single (key, list o f values) intermediate pair. We calculate the skewness between the generated partitions with the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">skewness = 100 − 100 * p ∑ i=1 S(i) p * max{S(i)}</formula><p>The closer the ratio is to 1 the less skewed are considered the generated intermediate pairs. Let P r be the set that contains the partitions processed by reduce task r, then the total size of data processed by r will be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">S(P r ) = ∑ i∈P r S(i).</formula><p>The achieved balance in regards to the data processed by the reduce tasks is given by the fol-</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">lowing formula: Balance = 100 * R ∑ r=1 S(P r ) R * max{S(P r )}</formula><p>The larger the ratio, the more balanced is considered the distribution of the partitions, because all reduce tasks will process approximately the same amount of data.</p><p>We compare the DP algorithm utilized by our DynamicShare framework to two schemes: (i) the default Hadoop approach where the number of partitions is fixed, and equals the number of reduce tasks, and (ii) Skewtune <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>: Comparison between LB and DP in regards to execution time when sketches are enabled detects a task which significantly lacks behind the other normally running, it orders the slow task to repartition its assigned data to the faster reduce tasks. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the comparison between our algorithm (Simple Partitions schema) with the Hadoop MapReduce approach and Skewtune. DP maintains the execution time of the reduce phase low even when the skewness reaches 80%. Skewtune fails to meet the performance of our algorithm due to the extra overhead of the repartitioning. Although it detects the tasks that suffer from skewed data it requires the repartitioning of their assigned data to the other normally running tasks, a procedure that is beneficial in case of long running jobs as was pointed out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, but for short running jobs, such the ones we examine in our work, leads to performance degradation. We do not consider Skewtune in case of variable number of partitions because it works at reduce task level. Regardless of the chosen number of partitions to use, some of them will be assigned in a task running on a slow node. These partitions will have to be repartitioned thus the overhead will be similar with the presented case.</p><p>In the previous experiment we evaluated DP with fixed number of partitions equal to the reduce tasks, in order to have a fair comparison with Skewtune and Hadoop.</p><p>To examine the impact of extra partitions, we compared our algorithm with the Load Balance (LB) algorithm proposed for MapReduce in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> which also proposes the usage of more partitions. The LB algorithm strives to maximize the Balance metric via a fair distribution of the generated partitions. For a fair comparison with our DP algorithm when sketches are utilized, we enhanced LB with sketches for the estimation of the partitions' sizes. In the partitions' assignment, each hash function of the global sketch is examined and the one that achieves the best Balance is chosen.</p><p>The displayed results concern 80% skewness between the partitions' sizes. Having the same number of partitions as Hadoop on LB does not offer any gain because the partitions' assignment will be same as Hadoop's, so we only consider larger values for the number of partitions. In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> you can see the execution time of the reduce phase when we use different number of partitions. LB achieves better results than the default Hadoop approach but the reduce phase requires higher execution time than our approach. This is mainly due to the fact that our approach is more opportunistic and less "fair" in the work that will be executed from the different tasks. Tasks on nodes with high processing capabilities will process more heavy-sized partitions than those that run on slower nodes. This "unfairness" between the partitions' sizes that are processed per reduce task, is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. For 40 partitions, LB achieves approximately 90% Balance in the partitions' sizes that are processed by the reduce tasks for the Twitter job, while our proposal reaches 64%. The difference in the execution times is significant though, as our approach requires approximately 1900 ms while LB 2800 ms. The results indicate that in heterogeneous environments, trying to achieve balance between the work assigned on the nodes of the cluster, may not be the right approach. An opportunistic algorithm, such as DP, achieves better results as it considers the heterogeneity during the partitions' assignment.</p><p>Finally we examined the benefit of using sketches in the partitions' assignment. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows that sketches mitigate the required execution time of the reduce phase as the number of partitions increases. This is the expected behaviour since the key-value pairs have more available partitions to be spread. The extra hash functions used in the sketches can generate more balance sized partitions, thus better decisions are possible for the DP algorithm to minimize the reduce phase execution time. We examined the requirements of the two approaches in regards to the time they require for deciding the partitions' assignment plan. For 45 partitions, the no-sketches approach required approximately 80 ms, while when we applied sketches, the assignment required 200 ms, so for cases such as the Twitter jobs where the benefits of the sketches approach are larger than 500 ms the extra overhead is negligible. However for very short jobs such as Youtube, a no sketches approach is preferable because the benefits of the sketch-based assignment are overlapped by the extra overhead of the assignment algorithm. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>, we display results concerning the comparison between DP and LB when sketches are enabled for both algorithms, although LB reduces the required execution time, DP still achieves better results.</p></div>

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the authors propose task-stealing solutions in the map phase.

Techniques like <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> aim to equally distribute the partitions to the available reduce tasks, however as we pointed out in the experiments such decision is not beneficial in a heterogeneous environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> adds the overhead of repartitioning the assigned partitions, an overhead which deteriorates the performance of short jobs and can lead to deadline misses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> requires a pre-processing step for estimating the partitions' sizes, adding overhead in the calculations thus making the execution of short jobs impossible.</p><p>Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> propose a new abstraction on top of Hadoop, the Shuffler component which is responsible for keeping the received partitions in the node where the reduce tasks will run. The newly added component enables intermediate data transmission between the map and reduce phase, reducing the cost of the shuffle phase.
